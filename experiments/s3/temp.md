Hey everyone, long time no see. While a lot of my old content has aged pretty well, both League and myself have evolved in 5 years, and I wanted to share some of this new knowledge and rework the episode structure to make it more understandable. As for the old videos, I'll be unlisting them, but they'll still be accessible in playlists in this video description if you ever want to look at them. I also wanted to do a rebrand. I'm no longer affiliated with the UNSW LOL Society, but check them out if you live in Sydney. These videos are intended for intermediate to advanced players who are several hundred or thousands of hours deep, and are looking to truly improve. They're not intended for beginners, and they're not 7 clickbait tips to challenger. They're focused heavily on the fundamentals of what you need to be a high level League of Legends player. When you watch the greats play, it's easy to get caught up in their moments of brilliance. But these moments of brilliance are because they've mastered the fundamentals and can consistently execute them flawlessly. As Michael Jordan said, the minute you get away from the fundamentals, the bottom will fall out of your game. I strongly encourage you to record all your games in first person view, so you can review your decisions while improving. When reviewing your plays, the most important parts of a decision are your intent and the execution. The intent is whether it was correct to go for a play in the first place, considering known factors like spell cooldowns, and unknown factors like chance of jungle intervention. Whereas the execution is whether you played it mechanically correctly. Having the right intent behind your actions means you're making the right play, even if you execute poorly sometimes. Whereas executing well on a poor intent will develop bad habits in the long run, even if you don't get punished every time. In this clip, Faker is posturing aggressively to be close to Graves in case he needs to back him up, but his spells are on cooldown. He's engaged on and takes a one-sided trade. Knowing that Renekton has no spells remaining and no flash, he trades back, but crucially misses his Q. Now let's say Faker was reviewing this play. There are two possible intents here. Either he positions forward so he can help Graves, but is in Renekton's engage range, or he pings Graves back and plays out of range until his E comes back up. Now intent is based on optimal play. If I play optimally, and they play optimally, is it still the right play to make? Syndra Q can be a hard spell to land sometimes, but I would say more often than not, Faker executes his trade correctly in this position, either by moving a little higher and casting E first to land a stun, or just being a little more patient with his Q to see which direction Renekton will juke in first. If he executed a trade back successfully, the health would be even, Syndra would be in a position to get level 6 first, and you've gained a jungle advantage. Results-oriented analysis leads to ingraining bad habits. If Faker decided that he shouldn't posture forward again because he took a bad trade, he'd be losing out on value in the long run, because the execution was the problem, not the intent. I've seen many people who absorb so much educational content, but don't actually get results. This is usually due to a lack of a learning plan. If you're watching these videos, or any educational material for that matter, there are just too many concepts to incorporate into your play at once. I suggest you focus on one concept at a time, and intentionally practice it, and then move on to the next thing. Because too many things at once will overload your brain and make practice less efficient. Set specific, achievable goals. For example, if you were trying to learn to punish opponents when they go for last hits, the first goal you would set is to walk forward when the cannon minion is about to die, just to get used to challenging an opponent's space. Next, you would do the same without missing any last hits, and then once you can do that, you would move on to doing it with all minions, not just cannon minions. And then after that, you would do it while thinking about opponent cooldowns, and then jungle ganks, and then wave positioning, until you've mastered the entire concept and it's all become muscle memory. The most useless goals are ones that don't have any actionable information, like my goal is to win lanes 60% of the time, or my goal is to get to plat 4. These goals sound good, but they're also functionally useless because they don't have anything specific or actionable in them. When concepts have become muscle memory, check them off in a google doc or notepad. This is an incredibly important step, don't skip it. Manually checking things off is essential for learning. It signals to yourself that you've actually incorporated the concepts into your play, it gives you an achievement that you can feel good about, and helps you track your progress. Focus on learning concepts and implementing them as your benchmark for progress. Not your rank, or whether you won or lost. Your rank and wins are byproducts of improvement, not the goal. Always remember that. Your rank in the short term will go down with practice as you attempt to incorporate unfamiliar concepts and fail until you master them. This is expected. Don't get attached to your rank, and instead embrace failure as a challenge. As Michael Jordan said, I've failed over and over and over again in my life, and that's why I succeed. So remember, mastery of the fundamentals is what leads to actual improvements in play. Don't just do them sometimes. Thanks for watching.
