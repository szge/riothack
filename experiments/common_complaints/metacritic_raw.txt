I believe the rating is self-explanatory. This game is not beginner-friendly. It has a toxic community, too many champions,complex mechanics and I am not a fan of its top-down view.

Try playing here and there with friends after work. It is just not fun at all. This game has so many problems it is insane. After this much time, this game just deserves to fail. I currently have a 25% win rate, in other words, only win 1 out of every 4 games that I play, but I do the highest damage and die the least amount of times on my team in 95% of the games. In 75% of my games I do the highest damage on both my team and the enemy team. My stats according to the internet are on par with challenger in every category besides vision, in which case I am on par with gold. I understand I am playing against way lower elo people, but I should not have a 25% win rate. This game is a dice roll. It does not matter how good you are. You were determined to win or lose before the game even started. Only very rarely does a player play so well that they sway the determined loss for their team. For example, the highest rank I have ever been was silver in like season 3. I am matched with players as high as diamond, and frequently with gold, plat, and emerald. Why when I have a 25% win rate? I have no idea. Just a really bad game and I would never recommend this game to anyone. In fact, I would go out of my way to tell people to make sure they don't play it and if they are playing it, I would try to convince them to quit.

League of Legends has a good foundation, but it's been incredibly poorly maintained. The base game (MOBA) is great in my opinion, a type of game that requires a lot of strategic skill but also offers good action. I say this because it's obviously not an FPS, but the precision required to aim with the mouse and move at the same time is not to be underestimated. Not to mention reaction times. That said, here comes the bad part: matchmaking, the community, and Riot's attention to players. I'll start by saying that Riot should require an IQ test before letting people register for this game, and then, as a result, they should manage matchmaking 100 times better. I, a player for over 10 years, can't lose matches because I'm playing with people who don't have a clue. Is this what I deserve for having learned all the skills, all the CDs, all the items, and everything else in this game? Is this what I deserve for having learned to always keep an eye on the minimap? Add some parameters, do something! Solo/duo are a joke. The deserving don't win, only the lucky ones do. I was even forced to change roles to try to win 1v9, but it's still not possible to win every time. Start permabanning someone, start developing new methods for giving and taking away LP (the points you lose or gain after a match). This could be a great team game, but instead it ****. Solo queue is a bunch of brain-dead. Create a decent tutorial! Maybe an easy one and an intermediate one for those who want to play seriously. If you started thinking about your players, maybe they'd even be happier buying skins in the game and thus increase your earnings exponentially. I really want to learn more and more as a support, but here and for Copa Voca, I can't. If my ADCs are silver (but they deserve iron), I'll never be able to learn anything new, and above all, I'll continue to lose matches because if my ADC commits suicide, his support is useless (I won't go into detail). Wake up and stop making fun of your players (customers). Then you have the nerve to limit my chat for a few days because I recommended some things to my ADC during the game to try to win, but he, being touchy like 99% of players, took it as an insult and started dying repeatedly out of spite. Having said that, if you don't play ranked it can also be enjoyable but for the rest absolutely not

Support people don't care about the real people that play. Had so many tickets put in. But none of them care to reason with me. especially with my last one where I was afk due to a storm. Then came back into the game and still won. But I get my account suspended thinking its for the wrong reason. Gotta love people that use there power for the wrong reasons

Don’t ever play this fcking game — all it does is fck up your life. I have 9000 hours in it, I’m a GM, and every single fcking update just makes the game worse. Instead of fixing it, they keep breaking it even more. Every new champion is more broken than the last (Tahm Kench is so fcking strong, and anyone who mains him is a son of a ****). Don’t play it, and don’t let anyone else play it.

Just about everything about this game's presentation is quality. I did kinda enjoy my time with it, but MOBA games are notoriously unfriendly to new players. This game's core experience isn't bad by any means, but i just don't find it fun. Everything about the game's mechanics were overwhelming. It's not for me, but it might appeal to you.

The gameplay experience is terrible, and the matchmaking system is bizarre. The champion selection is very limited — you can't freely choose, which makes it a complete waste of time and life. The process of entering the game seems carefully designed on the surface, but in reality, it offers a poor player experience. The limited champion pool and forced game duration make players feel completely controlled by the developers. If it weren't for the fact that this game dominates the market, this kind of design would never have existed. This may be the peak of the game, but it's also the beginning of its decline.

The client is awful. Completely freezes while in queue or in champ select and you have to face the penalties of missing these queues. It isn't my setup, look it up on reddit. Only penalties that people ever face for ruining your games are related to AFK timers that RIOTs automated bots are able to find, other than that they don't regulate the games at all. The client is exhausting though and I won't be playing this game anymore and really hope you never start lol

I've invested nearly four years into this game, accumulating over 1,300 XP and a 1,200+ mastery score. But despite that dedication, the current state of the game feels like a betrayal. Chest rewards have been severely nerfed, progression is painfully slow, and cheating is rampant—with scripters plaguing nearly every match. Matchmaking is chaotic and often unfair, making competitive play more frustrating than ****'s disheartening to see a once-promising game spiral like this. If you value your time and sanity, I strongly advise staying away.

Matchmaking makes you lose your life. Riot is absolutely ignorant. Just don't bother, it's not worth it. Matchmaking makes you lose games and constantly keeps you 47% win rate intentionally. And you will have a scripter in almost every game nowadays.

Game is inherently broken. Match making will put smurfson the enemy team and give you the most inbred chromosome shorts team mates. Your IQ will drop 50 points just by being in the same lobby as these people. Riot also never changes anything to help improve their game. In fact, they actively break their game on every update because they have no **** clue how their game feels from an end user POV. DO NOT PLAY THIS HORSE **** GAME, it is not worth losing the IQ over

1 point for the songs, 1 point for Arcane and 1 point for the skins. The game itself is nice, the runes system, the items but the CHAMPIONS are the problem. They seem to enjoy adding more and more overpowered champions. Furthermore, I don't think the devs play the game, they just ask ChatGPT how to balance the game.

A game that would've been fun and decent if it wasn't for greedy divorced mortgage 3rd marriage devs using 'Engagement Based Matchmaking'. Basically these companies will give you teammates to win 3-4 easy games in a row where all you have to do is perform mildly decent, and after those wins, they will give you 3-4 games of griefers and feeders. The idea is to make the user feel powerful and then feel very helpless, which psychologists have found will greatly increase a persons chance of spending in game money to alleviate the pain and feel powerful again. They don't want the user to feel any real sense of ranked or skill progression other than maybe 1-2 leagues where they were placed, because if the user gets to their true rank, then the user will get bored. Like climbing a mountain so to speak, you're not going to keep buying new hiking gear and food and water once you've already got to the peak of your mountain. TLDR: The wins don't feel that great, but the losses are HELPLESS. You'll constantly look back at town and see 1-2 guys AFK or some guy running down lane feeding on purpose. And magically these guys are always on your team if you are higher ranked than the league you are in. I have 2 accounts, one in Silver and one in mid Diamond. Both ranks are hardstuck. Tell me how a DIAMOND player can't rank out of Silver but I still manage to hold my Diamond rank for years on the other account? Because it's a forced 50/50 win rate based on their first impression of you. Yes, if you are professional level or extremely good at carrying, you can break out of the rank, but for those of us who are good but not insanely good, you are stuck in 'your rank' permanently. (I never read replies)

League of Legends, to many, is the peak of competitive gaming—a team-based strategy game with deep mechanics, flashy champions, and a massive global scene. But beneath its polished exterior lies something darker: a psychologically exhausting, emotionally manipulative, toxicity-fueled nightmare that often feels more like self-inflicted torture than entertainment. It’s the worst game not because it’s broken, but because it’s brilliantly designed to trap you in a cycle of addiction, frustration, and false hope.Every match starts with optimism—and ends with regret. You enter champ select, only to witness your top laner lock in Yasuo with Ghost and Ignite, refuse to leash jungle, and die to level 1 gank. Meanwhile, your ADC plays like they’re invincible, dives 1v4, dies instantly, and spams “?” ping on your support who was recalling. Your jungler? They get blamed for everything, even though they’re doing all the work. Midlane is either a god or a ghost, and there’s never an in-between. Your team tilts, rage-types, and surrenders at 15. Rinse. **** game wants you to feel responsible—for the loss, for your rank, for carrying your team of clowns. But the reality? It’s often pure chance. You climb not through skill alone, but through sheer mental endurance. The ranked ladder is less about winning games and more about surviving matchmaking chaos, one LP at a time. Sometimes you gain 17 LP for a win, then lose 30 the next game because your ADC had a bad breakfast. Promotions feel like job interviews, and getting demoted because of one bad game will haunt you for ****’s talk about balance—or the illusion of it. Riot's patch notes swing like a wrecking ball. One patch, tanks are unkillable raid bosses; the next, they melt like cheese. They’ll buff obscure champs like Skarner, and suddenly he's dominating pro play. Akali gets nerfed for the 200th time because someone at Riot has a personal vendetta. Meanwhile, new champions release with overloaded kits, 15 passives, infinite dashes, and a backstory longer than a novel—and they’re instantly meta. Viego, Bel’Veth, Zeri: all broken on release, and somehow left that way for months. And then there’s the community: possibly the most toxic in gaming. You could mute everyone and still feel the hatred radiating through the screen. Players flame for no reason, AFK at the slightest inconvenience, and throw games over trivial things like “you stole my cannon.” Every lobby feels like it’s one bad interaction away from imploding. The honor system is laughable. Reporting trolls? Good luck. Riot’s system often does nothing unless the player directly insults someone’s grandmother in seven **** let's not forget smurfs—those high-Elo players who descend into lower ranks to “have fun,” aka destroy newer or lower-ranked players and brag about it. They ruin the matchmaking experience completely. One team has a Diamond smurf going 20/0, the other has a Bronze player trying their best. Fair? Never. But the system allows it, and it just keeps **** client itself is a nightmare. Constant bugs, champion select freezing, crashes during loading screens, randomly muted teammates—it feels like it’s held together with duct tape and spaghetti code. Riot will spend six months designing a new skin line, but can’t fix a bug that’s been in the game since Season **** yes, the skins. League’s monetization model is a manipulative masterpiece. It’s “free to play,” but you’ll end up spending hundreds on beautiful skins, chromas, event passes, prestige editions, and loot boxes that give you 450 BE icons. The battle passes are convoluted, designed to squeeze as much time and money out of you as possible. You look better losing, but you’re still **** play? A sanitized, min-maxed version of the game where the same five champs get played every game, and the only interesting thing is whether someone dares to pick something off-meta. It’s impressive to watch Faker pull off miracles, but it doesn’t change the fact that your solo queue games are nothing like what’s on screen. If anything, it makes you feel **** why do people keep playing? Because Riot has masterfully baked in just enough joy to keep you hooked. That one clutch Baron steal. That pentakill in a teamfight. That rare moment where everyone actually works together. Those fleeting highs trick your brain into thinking it’s worth suffering through the rest. It’s a calculated loop of pain and pleasure, like a slot machine. You never know when the next good moment will hit, so you keep **** the end, League of Legends is the worst game because it’s so damn good at being bad. It’s a perfectly engineered system of stress, unpredictability, fake progress, and emotional burnout dressed in beautiful skins and esports prestige It’s not just a game it’s a full-blown addiction simulator. And we, the players, keep coming back. Not because we love it, but because we hate how much we want to love it. That’s the true curse of League.

The game is getting worse and worse from a gameplay point of view. When you are a newbie and play poorly, the system throws good players into your team, but as soon as you start playing well, game after game they start throwing worse players at you, often just trolls and toxic ones, supposedly you have to "teach" them. When you go to "op gg" you can see that the better the individual rating, the worse it is for the rest of the team. Ultimately, this led to the fact that in every game there are trolls or players who are more interested in writing in the chat than playing. For me, this turned into torture, although I loved this game before. It's a pity that they introduced this system, the game used to be much more honest and interesting. And in conclusion, I have not met a more toxic community anywhere else. I do not recommend this game to anyone. Just watch TV series and beautiful promo videos on YouTube

If you think that this game is for while away the evening, then it is not so. Even playing not in the rank, you will get a lot of negative emotions. At first everything will be fine, but the more you play it, the more you will realize that nothing here depends on your skill. Because Riot from patch to patch simply changes the same characters so that they are either not imba or are not completely dull. There are always charms that will drag even in minus kill. There will always be players who will leave the game. There will always be players who play for themselves. But if you go to play in the rank, anal punishment awaits you. You will win a couple of matches and lose six, because your team, regardless of your game, will lose. You will suffer, but continue to play. Welcome to the league of legends))

Matchmaking is not fair at all. it's just an algorithm based engagement system. What it seems to do is keep players hooked: when matchmaking favors you, you win a lot of games, but after some time, you end up in the “loser's queue” and get matched with players who have much less skill than you. It’s a business, I get it, but it still ****.

El juego como tal, la verdad es que es un juego con mucho desarrollo, y dedicación en años por parte de los jugadores y de los desarrolladores, los gráficos son agradables la jugabilidad es superadictiva pero al final el juego ha perdido mas de lo que ha ganado como videojuego. Se resume en que las mecánicas cada vez las hacen mas absurdas, cada día se llena de usuarios dañinos para el juego y hace que el juego tienda a ser frustrante y que se le pierda el interés, ya que es un juego que requiere muchas horas para poder disfrutarlo mejor, el hecho de que lleves mas de 30 minutos por partida y con un hecho de un jugador del equipo haga que esos 30 minutos se pierdan hace que no sea disfrutable, los desarrolladores no han escuchado lo que se les solicita para mejorar el juego en linea y mejorar el disfrute de partidas en equipo, al contrario se han dedicado solo a vender mas colores, mas personajes absurdos por no decir desbalanceados, para que el que pague microtransacciones le vaya mejor. Al día de hoy es un juego que perdió su rumbo original.

This game is horrible, I hate it from the bottom of my soul. I'll still give it a 10 because I have some excellent memories of the game, but the problem isn't the game, it's the community, which is toxic. In rank there's always some autistic person who takes a **** character and says "I'll play whoever I want, I don't give a **** about the meta". But it doesn't work like that, no matter how many times I report them, they always come back. Don't play this game if you're easily angered.

Well, well, if u want to have a fun time go touch some gras. If u want an endless cicle of frustrating balance changes, where OP characters get a skin right away - go for it. Pair this with the unprecedented obviously rigged and idiotic Solo/Duo ranked system, where the games' only goal is to make you upset and giving u nothing but the sweet relief of buying a skin. Go for it. Players and community is made frustrated by the system itself. Its not the "random" inflood of degenerates if so many people are behaving like this. I also read: Play with your friends - just dont. The algorythm for finding games will make you both miserable. You will get enemies waybetter than you, while you get the ancient waters of bacteria as teammates. I also read something about its survived for so long bla bla bla, i just want to say: dont get addicted like me - it will ruin your life. Inplain sight: Balance team with no clue - algorythms to screw you if u want to improve and improve your rank - no chance that you are in the right mmr, if u get 10-12 loosing and winning streaks - no chance that this is not rigged if it happens again and again - 50-50% win/loose looks different

The ranked system is purposely made so that you wouldn't be able to rank up. I created a smurf acc and got to dia in no time, while my main acc that has all the skins is stuck. They let you win abit then they match you with stronger players so that you lose. A genius way to make people grind forever. The game was a masterpiece first 3 years and now it's ruined like all the other games and movies and ect. Don't feed the machine and uninstall this evil product.

They don't do anything about toxic players and the only changes they make are ones that existing players hate. No change on how they address trolls in games and end up punishing the players that actually try. Avoid this game at all costs

Riot Games is a company that pretends to understand its own games, but the reality is completely different. Every update feels like it was made by people who have never actually played their own game. The balancing is completely random, matchmaking is a disaster, and the LP/MMR system in Teamfight Tactics is completely broken.Instead of fixing fundamental issues, they keep adding new features that only make things worse. Player feedback? Completely ignored. Communication? Almost nonexistent. If you look at their track record, you’ll see that they keep making the same mistakes over and over without ever learning from **** you’re looking for fair games made by a competent development team, you’re in the wrong place. Riot Games only cares about profits and couldn’t care less about their players.

Une communauté ultra toxique et rien ne semble être fait pour arranger les choses, super difficile de s'y faire une place en tant que débutant, le système économique qui est CATASTROPHIQUE, le studio se fout littéralement de ses joueurs, bien mieux avant la mise à jour, la progression des niveaux ne sert plus à rien, ça devient hyper long pour débloquer des champions gratuitement, tout devient payant. Juste lamentable

Just installed it, played about 10 games, and in 5 of them, someone just left. So, I decided to leave the last one too because I wasn’t going to waste my time on a lost match. And guess what they did? Banned me from the game. LMFAO are we supposed to be scared of ur ass game system and staying on it no matter what ? what about being a human tho

No matter what anyone else says league is a game that survived more than a decade now and it still has one of the biggest communities, game is good, sometimes it may be unballanced but riot balances things at most in a few weeks. Currently riot did some bad changes about skins and in-game currency but that will probably also be fixed in near future. community is ussualy toxic and unforgiving, like you cant make mistakes you have to be perfect to appeal them and sometimes even being perfect isnt enough so the game is not only about your skill but also your mindset as well, its drenching reason why this game survived this long is probably because of its uniqueness there are +160 characters and everygame you are playing is a different combination of champs and objectives like dragons etc. you also have to change your build and sometimes skill upgrades for this reason as well.

A game that requires, you to invest money so you can play characters, the “it's in-game currency, you can save up for any character” style argument goes **** it, if you're used to eating **** then keep doing it. From level 1 you can't play a certain position because you don't have the corresponding active ability, which completely ruins the concept of MOBA games. The game is a disgrace, huge online only because already mobile games are more demanding than that lol

After 8k hours in this game, I can full say that it has its ups and downs. The community is not the best in game and the gameplay is not the most fun,. However, playing with friends, the ARAMS and the yearly gameplay changes, makes it worth playing :) BTW its a free game, with a bad design in skin monetization (you need to improve on this RIOT)

it was fun at first but now in the recent months/years riot is just becoming too greedy and does not care for its players. i think now that they removed free chests and are taking aways more and more content from passt hey are demanding money from us. Dont get me even started on their unwanted and unneeded game changes and there are still many bugs that havent been fixed in years. Excuse my bad english.

The most recent update has absolutely gutted the free to play experience, as well as shoving the gatcha system down the players thought at every opportunity. this game actually gets worse with every update, and the higher ups all need to be fired.

LoL players are very sensitive; many struggle to learn the game and end up taking out their frustration in various ways. The truth is that LoL is a competent game and constantly evolving, but unfortunately, it’s also a game that can be very frustrating, which many people aren’t ready for. If the game were bad, it would have died out years ago. It’s both fun and controversial!

Lamentablemente, la cultura de esports en LAN no es la mejor, sino la peor junto con su contraparte del sur, y las estadísticas en eventos internacionales lo confirman, esto se debe a más factores de la toxicidad en ese servidor y del autosabotaje que muchos miembros practican por simples actos de odio. En mis tiempos de jugador desde Season 6 eh notado que la compañía cada vez menos busca intensificar los estándares de justicia al jugador que está comprometido por competir. Enfocando su esfuerzo en mejorar el contenido estético y crear sistemas de loot por azar. Generalmente el juego puede ser mejor pero debido a decisiones de la compañía y así mismo los despidos masivos hacen que esa oportunidad cada vez esté más lejos de ser realidad.

Unbalanced game. Idk why the balance team get paid. They just lock life steal champions and that is it. And they nerf the item that encounters life stealing. Good job riot. Keep going. At least we have a 250$ jinx skin.

Riot just manipulates people to keep playing their game using petty events and skins, while this company doen't even care about its players. The only thing that matters for riot is money, just like every company. And of course the matchmaking system is unfair and unbalanced. You either play a very easy game or you play with teamates whose skill level is four times lower than our enemies. Six times in a row i was the best on the team and we somehow lost all those times. The game has become "who will get one shotted first". And I also have seen videos of League's toxic community and i have to say that this game destroys people's mental sanity. And if Riot considers that to resolve all those problems is to mute chat or gambling system, Riot has failed to make a fun non-toxic video game. If riot decides to offer its players a fresh atmosphere in their game i will continue playing

Le gameplay est fun, addictif et varié sans être trop complexe. Jeu free to play et absence quasi totale d'éléments pay to win (quelques skins peuvent être avantageux sans pour autant être insupportable). En revanche, le jeu souffre d'un nombre excessif de smurfs, de comptes achetés, botés... et le système de bannissement laisse à désirer. La meta est souvent questionnable car elle est centrée autour des ventes de skins et des pro players. Mais bon, aucun autre jeu a réussi à me convaincre après autant d'années (première partie lancée en février 2014).

Honestly, this game is plagued of Scripters/cheaters, neither one of my reports are being take it seriously, I enjoyed playing when learning, but once you understand the champs, I am minimum mastery level 5 on each one of them, so I know what I’m saying, i ended up catching the Cheaters, Vanguard the anti-cheating system doesn’t works, they make fun of it. The matchmaking, is a manipulative system, that allows you winning or be defeated, for example, you are god with your main champ, the system match you with newbies players whilst the enemy team are all high ranked players, there isn’t a 5v5, it is a 1v5, it’s unfair, reason why i left the ranked mode, their own statistics show that just 20% players do ranked mode.THERE’S NO COMPETITION !the only way to enjoy that game is with 5 friends, that fend the unfair matchmaking act against **** game is a good game, handled wrong, and that ruins **** MOTHER ALWAYS SAID TAKE ADVICES TO ADVANCE, MY ADVICE IS ….Don’t try this, unless you have a bunch of good friends players.

Game is kinda fun. Full of bugs. keeps crashing and disconnecting - Followed multiple guides on how to correct it. Comparability mode, safe mode, graphics updates,DPI scaling, reinstalling, rebooting. After many "fixes" nothing helps. - submitted a ticket to try get some help. No solution for nearly a week. Game is just buggy. I have friends who play, and it seems there are enough bugs that they also had to try "work arounds" for all the problems. I would imagine a company this large would be able to put out a stable version. Please fix your stuff Riot.

A game with great potential that is rotting more and more every day. The developers do not add anything to keep players in the game, there are no events or activities to maintain the desire to play the game, the balance of which the developers refuse to deal with. Instead of respect for yourself, you will see only repression and indifference to you from both players and Riot. The new changes for the next season, which completely remove the ability to get chests for free (now you will only get 12! per year) - the last nail in the coffin of this game.

the game is unbalanced, toxic, the community is toxic, the company cares about making a couple of bucks over skins and they don't try to balance the game at all if you try to play ranked all that is waiting for you is insanity and misery because the games are fixed so you HAVE to go at 50% win rate however good or bad you play the game. All this game and company does is waste your time. I encourage you never to play this game or download it.

Complete sellouts, anygame thats RNG based on their platform caters to people who spend money through In Game Store. Algorithms will be altered better in your favor the more you spend. Riot wants to keep all players at 50% win rate as close to possible so they will force you onto losing teams before the match even starts. Putting 2 on your ignore list after a bad game, reporting said 2 players, then taking a 15 min break only to queue up again and have said same 2 players on your team once again in a promotional game match so if you dodge you auto lose. Seems like coincidence to me, those are the kinds of amazing actions Riots genious system commits while they blame the "players" for the toxicity. The game client is older than jesus itself and god forbid riot spend any of their hard earned scam money to give the players a new game client. Riot also will overtune champions to push skin sells, then after skin promotion has ended they will nerf said champion into the ground. If you want to play a game ran by coinslot eyed scumbags, this might be the game for you.

Check the bot fake reviews they are posting on google reviews to boost their sad 2.9 rating lol I have been playing games since 1985, I literally played the first commercial console ever created all the way till today, literally played every console out there and owned most of them, so when I talk about games, I know what I am talking **** the history of gaming, there was never a game that had to shut down its forums because of how toxic its community is. And there is not an online game that I know of which rewards mentally ill children by adding more ranks backwards like they did with "iron rank". I am very serious when I tell you that this game's community is THE BEST environment to study the psychological mental illnesses as you will meet the most damaged people in the word there. So... -If you want to meet creatures that have 0 IQ? -If you want a proof that some people are still apes? -If you want a great psychology case study to prove that this generation is mentally unstable and is mentally destroyed? -If you want to meet developers who don't give a **** about how their game is known for being THE most toxic gaming community on earth as long as their users are giving them their money? Well, you chose the right game! A couple of friends now have been trying to figure out how in the world you would get either 4 human donkeys or pro players, there isn't a middle ground. We figured out that what happens is that you will get say to Iron 3 as an example, they will keep putting you on the smurf team all the way to reach iron 1 with 98 points. One you reach there, they will then put you on human donkey team all the way to iron 4 with 0 points. Then that is when they will put you again with the smurfs non stop till you reach iron 1 with 98 again. We have tried it and recorded it, it is confirmed. The reason they do that is to get you hooked with some hopes that you will get of whatever your league is and then put you with human donkeys to 0 you back to the start and in your head you are thinking "I almost made it" So you keep playing. It is basically a **** mouse trap.

ive been playing for 15 years so of course i enjoy the game but it's bad. it could be so much better with real match matching. it doesnt matter how good you are, it's all random. this makes it so bad players can get carried higher and good players can get placed lower, so no matter what rank you are the games are unbalanced. After years of the same system riot thinks punishing the team as a whole is the answer while trolls, grievers, tilters, autofilled, disconnects(+rage quits), smurfs, and bad players exists in nearly every game in some form or another, often times multiples of any combinations of the above. You just have to hope your combination is better than the enemies, hence the randomness. Player's skill level are so all over the place that it creates unfun unsatisfying wins and unfun unwinnable games. In my emerald games it feels like im laning with an adc that's never even used a mouse and keyboard before and trying league for the first time. They dont know how to smoothly control their character, they dont know how to combo their abilities correctly, they don't move in between autos, cant cs, they have no sense that someone is about to shoot a skill shot at them, and they have no sense when to fight even when they have both summoner's up and someone's engaging, in EMERALD rank! These are just some of the basics they should easily be able to auto pilot just from getting to 30 to play ranked. Yet some how they dont and yet some how they are the same rank as me. they have 0 sense of danger and 0 skill to do anything. it's kinda crazy ive been playing this game for 15 years and i get matched with baby's first league game. This is not a rare occurrence either, and not just with the adc. many of my team mates struggle in my elo like they've never played a match in their life before. I also watch A LOT of twitch challenger players and sure 1% of the challenger players are actually challenger, but the rest are just as garbage as my team mates. so why am i even trying to climb when the games in higher elos dont even look any less random or any more enjoyable then what im experiencing now. so queing up and climbing is pretty much gambling on a slot machine especially as a solo que support main. riot is completely okay with everybody calling each other trash and wasting everyone's time all because of their poor quality match made games. nobody is actually ranked where they should be except maybe 1% of people. the more time you have to grind games, the more youll climb. not the better you get, the more you grind. as a side note ive stopped spending money on this game 8-10 years ago solely based on the fact riot doesnt deserve it. id rather set my 10 bucks on fire than give it to riot for a skin. once i find a game to replace league im gone for good, supervive and even heroes of the storm seem like better options at the moment.

This game feels like an uninspired and poorly executed attempt to replicate Dota, falling short in almost every aspect. The gameplay is plagued by severe balance issues, making it frustrating and uncompetitive. On top of that, the player community is overwhelmingly toxic, which significantly detracts from any potential enjoyment the game might offer. Overall, it lacks the depth, polish, and positive player interaction that are essential for a truly engaging experience

The Vanguard anti-cheat system does not work normally. My friend couldn't log in because of him, and also restart (it only starts when the PC is turned on, i.e. it needs to be restarted during the match). It is also impossible to recreate the game normally (within 3 minutes it is difficult to say whether a person will be able to enter or not), after this time you can only give up (26 units of raining are removed for this (I had a case when we gave up at the 3rd minute 48 seconds). The player selection system is not very good (i.e. sometimes they throw with a large rating spread). Playing team fight tactic is similar to playing in a casino (you win mainly not by arranging characters and tactics in the game, but by dropping rare and necessary class of champions, as well as items suitable for them). Poor performance and optimization (same for The Vanguard anti-cheat system) a of the client (at the same time, it is rarely updated).

Stupid game devs turned this great game into hot garbage. 1. No more original devs, who made this game successful and popular, like Morello and Gunsoo. Right now it's just a mess 2. At early times devs atleast made intentions to fix balance, like it should be in every game, especially with competition. With time passed, it turned into bad dev habit of making changes for the sake of changes, adding more and more unbalanced garbage without even intention to fix previous mess they made. 3. Toxic community. And devs refusing to adress problems connected to it. Like banning people for saying mean words, even when they can be muted, and ignoring griefing and intentionally feeding cases. The most ridiculous thing is that you can be banned for flaming griefer or inter, while they will still be unbanned 4. Original LoL had different classes with different roles, they took that system from original Dota and that's what hooked me. Now it's just a mess anyway. Over time they just kept adding more gold, damage and CDR to everyone turning the game from something like tactical chess and mindgames during lining phase, into League of oneshots and Fortnite-like gameplay: fast-paced oneshot simulator especially if you play with glass cannon type of class. Overall can't recommend this game to anyone and new players will struggle with toxicity and stupid leveling system

Go play dota There is a decent game underneath everything but it's too deep to find. Devs too worried about selling oversexualized anime schoolgirl skins to care. Nobody wanted to play jg so they made them op, so the players with most impact are elo inflated trash who just play jg because they can't last hit. Riot keeps releasing champs with more and more dashes and skills that punish you for playing a champ without a dash. Also the game punishes you hard for not building damage, everyone builds damage, there is no utility survivability, mobility. That just comes from your champ, you only build damage because the game is made for 12 year olds who only want big number. CC is super short but you can usually get 100-0 on a .25 second stun. They are constantly nerfing tenacity because assassins were unable to do their whole combo on .2 instead. Assassins counter squishy champs by one shotting you and tanky champs by having more mobility. Assassins are no longer bad against tanks or in teamfights. They only not have high winrate because the assassins players have their elo inflated, if assassin players are bronce and irons on gold lobbies, they will never have high winrates, it's that easy. They also have no skillshots or just use mobility to get on top of you at which point it's undodgeable. Also, every champ heals a lot, so being able to burst makes you incredibly strong. Also, nobody under 30 plays this game but riot told their chinese investors that it's super popular with kids, so if you say something that could be losely be considered an insult, you get banned (or if you say riot or if you say a champ is bad designed, you know, normal stuff). Plus, now it comes with chinese spyware. Go play dota

El gameplay es un 10, la comunidad un 5, y el emparejamiento un 0. Es una lastima que el sistema de emparejamiento sea tan pobre, de cada 10 partidas, probablemente, 3 sean parejas y las otras 7 se decanten para un lado o para el otro por diferencias muy notorias en el nivel de habilidad de los jugadores. Lamentablemente esta falta de equilibrio en las partidas repercute negativamente, no solo en el gameplay, sino también en los jugadores, dando como resultado una de las comunidades más toxicas de los videojuegos.

I played this game years ago, and got tempted after watching Arcane again. The experience reminded me of why I stopped in the first place. The game in itself is great, in theory, but there are a lot of things that make the experience of playing it frustrating in practice. The game is very obviously designed to be addictive, but in a negative way. As an example, if you have a winning streak, the game will matchmake you against completely unfair opponents for your level to basically throw you into a losing streak because, if I understand correctly, it just aims to get players at a 50% winrate. This obviously makes you want to come back to the glory days of when the game allowed you to win streak, but it won't really ever do that. You think it will, so you keep playing, hoping to just 'get gud' and compensate like that but instead it will kind of throw you scraps, and as soon as you start winning too much again you will get a super unfair matchup again just to make sure you lose again. It's just a never-ending cycle after that. That in itself would be tolerable, if only it did not apply this to entire teams, where you end up with 5v5s with one team being twice as levelled as the other, resulting in completely biased matches. I just don't understand why they wouldn't at least mix and match. The more I paid attention, the more I saw my matchups were mostly one team having no mastery on their champs versus a team with 4 out of 5 players with level 6 mastery or above, meaning one team did more than 30ish games with their champ at least vs complete newcomers to their champs. These games end up being quite boring, regardless of which side your are on. It's either a horrendous lose because you get steamrolled when you just are trying to learn new skills, or on the other side you get a win that is way too easy and unsatisfying. I heard this may be because there are not enough new players, so you end up being against lots of veterans even if you are not that experienced. I also heard ranked matchmaking maybe better, but did not want to get into that again as it is too intense and I just wanted some casual fun. The thing is, this may be a vicious circle, maybe there are not enough new or mid level players BECAUSE the matchmaking is not great so people end up leaving the game before they get any good at it. That is certainly why I am stopping again. All my matchmakes now feel poorly balanced and I just do not want to deal with the obligatory loose streak I have to go through before getting a fair matchup again. Since I played, lots of things have also changed, and they removed some of the best game modes in my opinion, Twisted Treeline and Dominion, which were great for casuals. Instead, we now have Teamfight Tactics, a pale replacement. Champs were always hard to balance, and there were broken ones from day one, but they definitely seemed to have upped the ante on that and added champs that have really overpowered toolkits. The cute little cat that is untargettable most of the time, Jhin which is basically making Caitlyn pointless because he's the same but way more powerful, Yasuo's brother whatever his name is that can basically damage you through 1/3 of the map and teleport right back to where he started that move, Evelyn that is constantly invisible and one shots you, coming out of nowhere. And after all that, you have the insane prices of everything in the game. Not a single thing is decently priced. I get they make their money on this, and they charge that much because somehow some people must pay for it, but it seems like excessive use of capitalism and pure greediness at this point. Surely with a profit of 24 mil last year and twice as much projected this year, you'd think they could charge a bit less than a fiver for a damn rune page and throw the players a bone. I get it for skins, but this is just a quality of life thing, and you have to PAY for it. Alternatively, you can grind maybe 100 hours+ for a single rune page with blue essence. Great. I won't talk about the game being toxic etc... because that is definitely on the players, not Riot, who have genuinely added quite a few things to try and make it better. But overall, I don't know how else to put it, this game just isn't very fun anymore. It's a long way from its origins with Dota on Warcraft III. It was just more fun before it became this massive industry dependent game that people take too seriously, including Riot themselves. There is no place for casual gamers here, and it's a bit of a shame, because it did use to be a laugh in the very beginning.

This game needs a new fast game mode like nexus blitz or URF. They removed twisted treeline and dominion and now we are stuck with summoner's rift, Aram (which is not fun to play all the time because its random pick) and TFT. Put some joy for your users and give us a new fast game where we can actually enjoy the game again. Because no one enjoys summoner's rift anymore and they have only given us Aram the last couple of years.

I started League 3 years ago. It's the first MOBA-game I tried. I wouldnt do it again today. I now know, that Dota 2, another big MOBA-game, is the better option for me. Because in League, many go afk or surrender the game and then it ends before it's finished. It's hard, it doesnt matter how good you play, you could be the best player of the world, but when 4 agree to surrender, the game ends automatically. Its ripped out of your hands and you can do nothing about it. It takes a lot of time to learn such a game, I recommend new players to think about which of the games is worth it, before investing too much time. In League, unlike to Dota 2, games often get surrendered. For me, this is the most frustational expierence the game constains. People who played this game since the beta-phase before season 1 told me, that surrendering got easier over the years. Riots recently made it even easier for people to surrender, this phenomena ''surrender'' is increasing and nothing is more demotivating than playing all the time and learning this new complex game to ranked and then dont even get the chance to win because the game ends before its even finished. And this happens a lot. In Dota this seems to happen much less. Maybe bc of the community, but also players who only want to play easy matches and surrender the hard one dont even have the chance to surrender as easy as in League. Me and some friends honestly think about quitting with League and starting with Dota 2 instead. A better community, nicer designs and medieval vibes, there are many reasons, but the deep, forcefully strong, negative emotion, that arises when you loose a game where u put in all your effort just because the others think its a loose and riot seems to go even more towards this direction

The game revolves around a 5v5 player matches. Sadly, there is an obvious system behind that defines who plays against who, outside of the basic 50% chance for victory for both sides. In some games you are put in an extremelly free victory scenario, and in others you have an impossible to win game (Because of trolls). Most of the game no longer revolves around skill matchup, butrather the enforcement of 50% win rate for all players. There is no real competition in the ranked system.

Played this game for far too many hours. The game has a lot of problems in it current state but that only over the last year/s. If they are able to fix it it would be a 10/10 if they don't the rating goes down to 4/10

I try to just have fun with my friends. These devs have given up. The game is terribly balanced no matter the game mode. Ranked is filled with people who leave the game after match making or intentionally feed. We have tried playing more casual games like the draft and blind pick each game is poorly balanced so each game tilts either way. ARAM is impossible to play, I am writing this review after losing 10 games in a row with a triple stack. I know what you are thinking. You're bad. I may be but after the scales being tilted in one teams favor in every game mode, the lack of balance in the characters and a buggy client. I hate to say it, but I will be done.

Truly, a terrible game. This is coming from someone who played league for far too long. And no, I didn't come here after rage quitting to leave this scathing review, I just genuinely think League of Legends is a terrible game in pretty much every aspect. I wouldn't have said that in the past but I'm saying it now and I wish I hadn't played it so long. It's the only game where I actually, eventually question my own moral character because it turns me into a real ****. No other game (or other person, place, or thing for that matter), competitive or not, has ever been able to turn me into as big an **** as I am in League. This game is notoriously bad for your mental health. It's a commonly talked about topic in the League community. The community is one of the worst, if not the worst. Riot seems to almost promote the toxicity by never banning or punishing the ones truly making the game unplayable for you from time to time. They FINALLY implemented a proper report system after NEARLY A DECADE of complaints showing that they truly don't care about it. Instead of cleaning up the community, it seems to have done nothing. I've heard of many people who simply complained about someone ruining a match and ended up with a permanent ban when the person actively ruining the game got a slap on the wrist... or absolutely no punishment. A lot of the streamers and youtubers are quite toxic. It's gotten better but just a few years ago, all the popular streamers were toxic as hell. What an example to set for the community. Other reasons to avoid (in short hand): terrible balancing, cutesy or edgy (childish) character designs, power creep (each new character has more and more ridiculous abilities - ala 5 dashes on low cooldown when old champs could dash once), matches are truly miserable to play if you're not winning due to hyper snowballing and overloaded damage (many times you can't do anything but wait the game out), one singular person can ruin an entire match and make you lose (and some people actively do this with seeming immunity), terrible graphics, constant skin releases as opposed to proper balancing or upgrading THE ACTUAL GAME QUALITY, pretty much everything is about damage when it really comes down to it (one dimensional at it's core), game is run on spaghetti code, client was absolutely terrible and buggy for years on end and for some still is, vanguard (anti-cheat) now requires you to give Riot (potentially) access to every single file on your computer, the ranking system is EXTREMELY grindy (goodbye career and wife if you want to play competitively)... need I go on? Everything about this game is outdated and anyone who defends it is gaslighting themselves because they can't just up and leave it after investing thousands of hours. I'm not saying you can't enjoy it, or that it's all bad, but there is no denying the points I've made and in my mind they far outweigh the positives. Many people agree with these sentiments but just can't put the game down for some reason, and even go as far as defending it, further alienating their self integrity. Another reason for the toxicity you will surely encounter if you play this game. You're a prisoner playing with fellow prisoners (exaggeration but analogy fits). League is a bad game. It just is. It's setup to make you suffer, and to pay them while doing it. Period. There's more to it, but this review is long enough. Seriously, do yourself a favor and if you really want to play a moba, find one that actually cares about its community, or at the very least cares about its game. I earnestly believe a large reason for League's popularity is because we are living in both a masochistic society and a society that promotes quick dopamine rushes. The game infuriates you to no end (and is designed to) so that your lows are lower and your highs are higher.. leading to heavy addiction. All competitive games are like this to some degree but I believe league is actually designed specifically to lead you to addiction, suffering, and reaching for that golden apple at all times. Should be renamed to "Gaslighting.. the Game." I mean that. League is truly predatory and so is it's developer Riot, which is owned by Tencent. Look them up if you haven't... Final note: I've been playing DOTA 2 and it is infinitely more satisfying so far. I have about 50 games in DOTA 2 and while it can be frustrating sometimes, like any competitive game, the experience has been far better. It's been said before that Dota is more like chess and I agree. League would have to be checkers in this analogy... maybe connect 4.. Is Dota 2 perfect? No, but it is LEAGUES better than league, anything is.

I tried downloading this game a few days ago and it feels unplayable. the tutorial teaches you 3 of the fundamental mechanics but leaves you on your own to try to figure it out. the camera in this game is horrible, its very hard to navigate and several champions hit you from 1-2 screens away. the tutorial doesnt help with this at all and it just switches from locked to free at some point. there is no skill based matchmaking, i played my first game against people who are also in their first game which i did bad in, then they put me into a game with someone who has been playing for months. the interface to do anything except for in a match is very confusing to. there is no tutorial or any piece of information on how to find things. if you want another reason to kill yourself I highly recommend this game.

I can not like this game. I am happy that it did not pick up my interests unlike other people, I gave it a try with friends anyway. But still those who play it and I asked will never admit that they like it. The game is purely online pvp, which is not a bad thing, but after about 10 games with friends, we got enemy players withmore than 1000 hours of playtime and ruin the whole fun, becaue the game is purely skill based, therefore unplayeable of those staring and playing rarely. The lenght of a match can differ therefore resulting to matches loner than an hour when you are unlucky, which is still the average daily playtime of an adult with a job and responsibilities. The thing is, that many people can not let go of it due to their massive playtime, resulting to them only playing it out of desperation or another force telling them to contine. Always remember: A videogame should bring you joy, if it does not, stop.

This game isn't just terrible, it's only going to get worse. Developers are becoming more confident and bold in their desire to remove personal influence from the game. Over the years, they've made the game a clown fiesta where you just join random skirmishes on the map and hope it doesn't end in something catastrophic. Any other action will greatly reduce the chances of winning, and you have no other means of victory. This season they also introduced a forced grindwall in the emerald rank, now when you get there you won’t be able to quickly get past it (and this is the worst elo in the game), in addition to all this they have noticeably increased the loss of LP in case of falling in the division, which increases even more grindwall. It’s immediately obvious where the brilliant developers of World of Warcraft are going to. При этом в случае если ваш винрейт выше 50% подбор будет усиленно топить и если наоборот то закидывать вас туда где вы выиграете без шансов даже если уйдете в туалет. Все это служит исключительно для удержания онлайна. This is not a game, but one complete scam. There is nothing fun about it and if it has ANY competitor with the same level of arcade, it will not last even a year. The only reason people play this game is the old engine, which makes the game feel extremely dynamic. This game has literally no other redeeming qualities.

I've been playing since season 2 and just recently came back cause I saw they updated the bots after like a decade.... jumped into about 50 co-op vs ai games and was pretty disappointed tbh. Bot ai is still poor but they sort of jungle now, not sure why they've been making a big fuss about this new ai update? I was under the assumption they'd behave a lot like real enemies as per riot bot team update but they are still trash. New champions are alright nothing special, they've updated icons but the graphics remain somewhat average in this current year... idk pretty let down honestly to come back to the game after this long to find the game has changed dramatically but not neccesarily for the best. Edit: Updating my review in regards to the new $500 dollar skins.... this is the exact problem with league now, riot is a huge corporation these days I'm unsure of their finances exactly but there's no way they need to do this other than corporate greed. How about making the game better instead of finding new ways to monetise? Just another dying live service that is trying to squeeze everything out the remaining last whales ( look at hearthstone also released a long time ago is losing players but doing everything they can to milk remaining players instead of making the game better) The fact on Riot's YouTube channel they even put the tag 'expensive ahri' I think it's absolutely disgusting and solidified my opinion on league that it's a dead game was only good for the first 5 seasons or so, now it's just corporate sludge. Finally, regarding my previous review after the bot update early this year, nah they haven't even touched the bots since and they're still absolutely rubbish to play against like ai from the 90s. Embarrassing company and an embarrassing dead game being squeezed for it's last bit of cash, what a disgrace riot are posting videos at their head office with progressive people talking about content but then releasing a $500 skin, **** riot you're not fooling anyone with your purple haired staff. I haven't touched a riot game in years they're rubbish now, this is the final thing to make me boycott riot just like I have ea

It is the reason why the moba genre still exists. But despite the efforts of the development team, the presence of toxic people turns you off from the game. In addition, the Korean League, which is the best league, has put a stop to the producers of the game because although the necessary steps have been taken in the field of e-sports, there has been a period of stagnation lately. I hope it is not doomed to a period of decline.

Da regelmäßig neue Champions veröffentlich werden ist es wichtig viel Zeit in das Spiel zu investieren - für mich am Ende zu viel Zeit, Der ARAM Modus ist Kurzweilig und hat den Spielspaß noch um einige Jahre verlängert.

Could have been a fun game for me, was it not for the noob-hating community. League of Legends could have been a fun game for me, but unfortunately, it is another example in which for me personally, it never came around the way I hoped. League of Legends is a fast paced, adrenaline pumping MMO Tower Defense /Battle Arena game, in which two teams fight it out on a map, trying to destroy each other’s Nexus. You control one of the many unique champions, in which you set forth towards the other players base. The base is defended by turrets and other structures and a hero can buy upgrades for their base when they are present in it. NPC “minions” are constantly summoned and go straight for the enemy base. Killing this monsters/minions, earns gold and XP for the champion to level up, increase their skills and buy more stuff. The maps are square with one diagonal lane, straight towards the enemy base. However, two more lanes from the left and right side, follow the square’s lines, and also make a connected path to the base. The action, tactics, coordination and tension is great and matches can take a few minutes with noobs like me, or more than an hour for skilled **** graphics and sound is this game are a little basic, but for a game like this, it works and does not matter that much. The controls, interfaces and menu’s are simple and easy to understand. Even a noob like me got the hang of it pretty fast. When LoL first came out, it already looked interesting to me, but at the time, I did not get around to it yet. Then, some years later, I wanted to give it a try. I still did not know the mechanics or the way it must be played, so I played the tutorial and was ready for some matches. But for me, here is where it did go wrong. I connected to a lobby, and immediately got kicked out. This process repeated itself multiple times, until I finally connected to another lobby, stayed in this time and got playing. I was still a noob at the game and in this match, I got constantly reminded of this. I did not play fast enough, got called names, got noob shamed, and overall, the experience was terrible. The moral of this sad story is, that there is no room for plebs and noobs like me. You need to play God tier, like the professionals. Make one mistake, react too slow or make one wrong move, and you will regret it. Even though I basically “gave” a victory to the opponent, I just got criticized and demolished for playing “too bad”. For this reason, I played for exactly ten hours, spread out over a few days, in hope that my own experience with the game could redeem itself, but alas, it was not the case unfortunately. Such a shame, but I did like the game in general. But in this state, I am just “afraid”, to start any match, and this is not how you should play a game or spend your free time to relax on. So, once again based on my own personal experience, I cannot recommend League of Legends, unless you have a weird kink for shaming.

This is a decent game. Sure there are quite a bit of problems but which online game doesnt have problems? Then I see people say stuff like "the game is toxic" and then in the same sentence they tell riot employees to kill themselves. Like maybe you are the problem. Balance can be **** at times but most of the people here lost one ranked game in silver elo against a yasuo or something and immediately call it broken. And for all the people saying they are "addcicted" to the game get some help I wouldnt want to see you try alcohol or other drugs which are actually addictive and harmful. Stop complaining about non existent problems and stop letting out your frustrations on rioters because (maybe except for phreak) they are all doing their best.

The game has many aspects that would make you think it is a good game. But this is only superficial. Their trailers are always a blast and the advertisement on their website would make you just think that. Once you dive deeper into the game... understand the mechanics, how interaction with the team works, you realize that it is designed to fail. Some champions are overtuned, others are undertuned, some are somehwere in the middle - this alone is a reason to frown, but the real mess starts when teams with players, that do not fit together have to cooperate. The problem is that you are very dependant on your team, yet you are just thrown into games at random. And there the mess is starting. One minor mistake of an allied player can ruin the game for you, at the same time people do not accept the slightest criticism. They will start to grief the game (it is called "running it down" in the game). It will just not work out. But what really bothers me - and here Riot fails heavily - you would expect that the griefers get punished, but in fact they do rarely receive the punishment, but more the people who lash at the griefers ... again which is completly natural. All in all the treatment and the arrogance of Riot handling this matter is just the reason, why I can't keep on playing the game.

These games are just degenerating to **** shows, I kinda have the feeling that Riot somehow accepted how the game has developed. They come up with fancy stuff with the intention to reduce toxicity only to have the opposite effect. The core reason is that they feel responsible for the toxic individual. They provide him safe passage even when violating the community rules. This is a major flaw. Without public shaming and no ability to hide for the trolling/toxic creature, they have little motivation to change their behavior.

I am not sure what to say...I am just very frustrated on how the game developed over the years. It is not my job, to help Riot to improve. Usually that is done by expensive consulting agencies. All I have to do is express my feedback with this rating and move on to a better game - which there are plenty - until Riot has resolved the issues.

SkyGetsJinxed
(SO MUCH WASTED POTENTIAL) As someone who had hated League for years because of how the gameplay looked and what other people said about it I had absolutely no interest in playing. Until I stumbled upon ARCANE and fell in love with it. The world of Piltover & Zaun was something I became obsessed with. Especially the way the characters were written, one in particular (look at my name ;) The Music, the animation, the story telling, it was all perfect in every way. So I downloaded the massively world popular game and didn’t love it at first. (I only played for the champions and the world they came from.) and now 3 years later after ARCANE I am still here. Would I recommend this game to people? Absolutely NOT! I only play this game for JINX I swear. I now have 1 Million pts on JINX alone and have learned a lot about the game. “IT IS WORSE THAN HELL!!” Oh my god I swear I haven’t had fun until ARENA came out. The grind is insane to climb in ranked and to even learn how to play the game effectively at all takes another level of dedication that I can’t even begin to explain!!! It’s the most toxic game I’ve ever played and after all these years I finally see why this game is so hated. It genuinely crushes my heart to see the amazing world of RUNETERRA go to waste in a game like League of Legends. I have memorized and learned all the lore of each champion and the absolute beautifully written and designed world they came from. with the RIOT MMO that is coming out soon I have some hope that people we be able to love the world of RUNETERRA like I do. I’m so passionate about this that I have entered a trade school for art and world design and am dreaming of getting a job at riot games. I took the world of RUNETERRA and put it into my own game that I have have spent almost 2 years filling up 4 sketch books with ideas. I could literally save RIOT games right now with the things I have came up with. Maybe one day RIOT will be known as the greatest game developing company of all time. Thanks for reading and I hope you have gained something from this!

Hadn't played this game for a good year and a half so decided why not give it a shot. Holy **** if this game was bad before its nothing compared to where it is in this stage. Before it could atleast be enjoyable at times but 20 games in I haven't had one single experience where I said "damn that was fun". Absolutely awful, matchmaking has somehow gotten WORSE than it is. Community is still a ****. If this game wasn't free and didn't have that nostalgic element to it I would say it would've been dead by now. Just an awful experience, uninstalling the client right now.

the game has many issues: balance, toxicity, overall game quality/design and also technical ones. I do not want to know what kind of a mess the code base behind this game is. i think it has never been overhauled. Most of the time there are server issues or bugs, also the client is insanely unstable and sometimes games just crash, when they are about to start. I mean if this was a small company...maybe it would be forgivable, but not Riot, after all these years. It really shows they do not care for their customers.

Actually the game is quite good... at least in theory. You have different champions that serve specific roles inside a 5 player team that matches against another 5 player team.... That is but only the theory. Practically you do not have a team ... and you do not have an evenly matched team because champion balance is rather off. Also the community is very toxic so every game isn't really enjoyable. I also have very long queue times and it takes way too long to get into a game

It is a classic 5v5 MOBA, 5 enemies and 4 allies and yourself. MOBA isn't too popular these days anymore. League is the only game of its kind that somehow survived. But it is declining very rapidly in game quality. There is a mess of too many champions some overpowered, some too weak, nobody at Riot has a clue of how to put them alongside each other into the game so they can coexist without making the game unplayable. Yet Riot is pumping out new Champions without even realizing what damage they are doing to this **** new champ "Hwei" is a complete joke, he can do everything and anything, but the last one Birar... was as well complete ****. It is just unplayable. Every game is pure pain.

The game is just designed to get you tilted. Every aspect will result in a significant disadvantage to either side. Then you are stuck in a situation, where you do not enjoy the game anymore, but get punished if you decide not to. Hostage taking is a huge problem (along other major issues that this game has and Riot fails to tackle them). My advice: Play something else!

Played many Mobas,from Dota 1, HoN over Dota 2 and HotS to League of Legends. Every game has their upsides and downsides. But for me the 2 most important aspects are a good champion balance and and "enjoyable" (whatever that even can mean in a Moba) . Sadly League of Legends scores last in both of these 2 important criterias. That is why I recommend not to play it.

The game has been degenerated to a point where your own influence you have on a game is very little and mostly comes down "how many coinflips do I lose and do I lose the important coinflips". Upon realization you can speed the enjoyment of the game up by just flipping 4 coins, calling head or tail and then see what the outcome this. By doing this you evade the long queue times or getting autofilled, while having the same effect - minus the cancerous toxicity that Riot fails to tackle for over 10 years. Go die Riot.

Very frustrating experience. It is basically impossible for new players to get into the game, because it is infested with smurfs. Also the balance of champions is a bit off... I did not play for long, but I could immediatly see that some champions have an overloaded kit, while others - I think the older champions - basically do not have anything. There is a website, where you can look at the winrates of champions and it is true what has already been said on other reviews here. The balance is terrible! Also I think that the skins are too expensive, they barely show any good details, but are completly overpriced for what they offer. All in all not a experience worth trying. In retrospective I am shamed that I spent some time on this rubbish!

I am rating the entire lifespan of the game, but in conlcusion - since it has been so bad for at least 5 years now, the overall rating is 0. Ofc only Riot is to blame for this, nobody else. Every problem that makes the game absolutely not enjoyable to play, could be corrected by Riot and nobody else. Do not blame the community for Riot' failure.

It was good of some time, althought the developers came and copy pasted the idea of custom mode DOTA of Warcraft 3. What I don't like about game is toxic mechanics that make toxic community. Lasthitting, getting more gold and xp for kill, than for assist - these are all points, that make the players raging at each other. The game has just gone in wrong way in terms of user friendlieness for new players. The game has the strong base of players and will though go on for a long time.

Какая же гора у этой игры проблем, но разработчики всегда рады создать новые. Самое по сути главное это то что за эти годы они максимально нивелировали личное влияние в игре. Теперь по сути по карте происходит море случайных файтов 4 vs 2, 5 vs 1 и тд.Нет никаких рамок или условий которых нужно придерживаться и ввиду этого каждый ранкед превращается в просто случайный набор драк в которых побеждает количество. Ваше влияние на игру давно умерло и вы просто заложник в игре в которой ни на что не влияете. Не так важно выстоите вы линию против троих, может быть вы даже будете убивать их на дайвах, все решится исключительно случайными драками 3 vs 1, 4 vs 2 которые будут навязыватсья в случайных местах без цели просто потому-что чемпионы без задач бегают по карте не теряя в ресурсах.

As for current state the game is objectively terrible. The following lists contains the major issues priorized in order to how much negative effect it has to the customer (player): 1. Poor balance: Generally speaking Champions in a MOBA should not have more than 1% or at most 2% average winrate divergence. Even 2% is severely notable and has a negative overall experience for the majority of players and indicates that intensive tuning and careful adjustments have to be immediatly made to prevent further degeneration. Currently (Patch 13.24) the best champion in League of Legends averages at 54.29% winrate, while the worst champions are at46.47% (omitting the newly released champion). 2. Poor game design: The game forces you to play alongside 4 players, which you can't control, but heavily depend on. While usually teams - even in a professional business environment - undergo different teambuilding phases that stretch over several weeks, Riot "demands" of you to immediatly cooperate with those players, despite the majority is not willing to cooperate and even actively sabotages your gameplay. Once in this situation you are a hostage, since you can't preemptively abort the game without getting punished, but you also can't effectively play the game, since it requires teamplay, when lacking a team to play with. Despite Riot claiming to do something againt griefers, the process is less than ineffective - and this is a kind phrasing. The system is easily tricked and hardly controlled by any instance in charge. The natural, human reaction of expressing frustration - the right of free speech, where our ancestors fought and died for - is however annulated. You only have the right to enjoy the game, but you are not allowed to express criticism, neither in game nor towards Riot on any of their platforms, without suffering severe consequences. 3. Toxic community: League of Legends always had the image of having the worst community with the most unpleasant people to play with. And this is not an understatement. The only thing that is worse than year X League of Legends community is year X+1 League of Legends community. Riot desperatly tries to implement mechanisms to prevent this like "muting the post game chat on default", or improving their Chat-analyzing tool to detect common phrases considered as toxic, but of course this has no effect, because they are only fighting symptoms. The root of toxicity is the game and game design itself, as it is designed to create tilt and negative atmosphere. 4. Game Integrity Degeneration: It is safe to say that nobody at Riot Games ever thought that League of Legends would last that long. Now being over 10 years old it has far too many champions to be put in one game together. Riot failed to establish a rotation system, where some game elements become inactive. The game is full of **** and dead content, which nobody can comprehend. Also there are many technical issues and UX/Usability flaws that would be forgivable for an indie game crafted in a garage, but not by a multi-million dollar company charging 20$ for a mediocre cosmetic content. New players will not find a way into the game, for the reason of too much content to be learned at once and for the other reason of there being no real beginners anymore, or to be precise: the amount of smurfs that annihilate the fun for new players is another aspect where Riot drastically fails to handle. The game maybe was once good, maybe even the most enjoyable game on the market, but these days are long gone. Riot is trying to ride a dead horse here. I am happy for everyone who decides not to play this game after reading my review. If so: Good job, you made the right decision.

- some bugs are still not fixed for years - terrible matchmaking. for example: what does a silver or bronze player do in a platinum solo rank game? - players are going afk and still you lose almost same as much points as you would play regular - client is slow and lags, there is a skip button for stats after a game but for what? you still have to wait till you can join a game again - terrible ranked system and internal matchmaking rating. if you have a good MMR you get stronger opponents although you are still in low elo. - depending on your MMR: when you lose you lose more points and when you win, you get less points. therefore you can win more games and still lose more points + polite and fast support

Playing this game is what I imagine smoking cigarettes is like to a smoker. If you want to start playing this game, you probably shouldn't. The community is overwhelmingly toxic, and the gameplay is unintuitive, which makes it a difficult and lengthy process to learn the game enough to even know what is happening. Combined with the toxicity, being bad at the game is treated like a capital offense. As such, new players are likely to be flamed frequently until they become more skilled at the game, which will take months at the minimum. Even then, it will merely slow in frequency, and will never stop, regardless of skill level. Despite this, there's something about this game that keeps me coming back to it. This isn't an uncommon sentiment among players, who will frequently recommend against playing League, with varying seriousness. Even with this poor reputation, the game remains massively popular, so there must be some aspect of it that keeps it's player base interested. While it is hard to single out any individual factor with certainty, I believe that the same complexity which makes the game hard to learn is also what makes it so addicting. As there are presently 166 unique champions, each with about 1 passive and 4 active abilities, which adds a huge number of things a player has to learn to understand what is happening. Even after learning enough champion abilities to get by, a new player still has to understand the macro aspects that dictate the actual outcome of the game, such as farming, map objectives, wave management, etc.. While this complexity is difficult to approach, it means that your time spent learning the mechanics and playing games will directly lead to improvement at the game. This is what has made League so rewarding to me, as I can distinctly notice constant improvement over my ~1100 hours playing it. Unlike the main positive factor of League, I can easily identify the main negative aspect as the toxicity. While the enemy team is frequently toxic, the majority of the toxicity comes from your own teammates, who are likely to constantly criticize you for mistakes, argue with each other, and place blame for failures on anyone except themselves. In my opinion, this behavior stems from two sources. Firstly, players become embittered over time, as they are exposed to constant toxicity in game. Secondly, over the large number of hours it takes to even understand what is happening players often stop enjoying the game itself, and only play because they like winning and/or increasing their skill rating. Due to this, any mistake or failure in game can lead to anger, further increasing the toxicity in each game. This creates a reinforcing cycle in which toxicity blooms like a fungus. If you ignore (or /mute) the toxicity in game though, it immediately becomes much more enjoyable. In combination with taking breaks whenever I notice myself getting frustrated or burnt out. While no one is perfect, actively choosing not to engage with toxicity has allowed me to actually have fun playing the game and learning more. While it is certainly easier said than done, League is a game with a lot to discover, if you are willing and able to manage the toxicity of the player base, however you might choose to do so. If you are a current League player who my statements might also apply to, please consider making an effort to disengage with toxicity, for the sake of your own enjoyment.

I've played this game for over 4000 hours and now I just hate it! It has great characters and world lore, but technically the game is terrible! Below I will list all its main disadvantages, which is why I quit the game. 1) Horrible Launcher! You try to select a position and nothing changes. It constantly breaks something after every update. It can not be customized. 2) Terrible game search! You want to start the game search and go somewhere, but instead you have to sit and wait for the "accept" button to appear. Then you have to sit for 2 hours in champion selection, only to have someone quit the game at the end and you have to do it all over again. They added a quick game, but you can't even pick one champion for 2 positions in it! You can't pick a line that isn't prioritized in it! So they just killed the fast game mode at the root! 3) There is no interregional game! Why do I have to sit and wait for 2 hours to find a game? Why can't it be done that the game is searched between all players, and not only by individual regions? In all games it works perfectly well and no one has never complained! Because of this it is impossible to find the game at night! During the day you have to wait sometimes for 20 minutes if there are few players from your country playing now! 4) Terrible camera! I like to play games when the camera is attached to the champion. And it's just disgusting! It's jerky, there's not much screen space, you can't see anything. Why can't they add a normal smooth camera that follows the champion? So that it shifts slightly towards the mouse? So that it shifts to the opponents if they are nearby. There's a mode to shift the camera if it's attached to the champ. And this function is just disgusting! If you accidentally hit the border of the screen with your mouse, the camera will just fly away and you can say that you have already lost the fight. Why can't you make the camera move a little bit to the side of the mouse? Not only when the mouse is on the border of the screen. 5) You cant attack an enemy without pointing the mouse at them! Add a feature to have the character attack only the enemy champion! The game has a similar feature, but he attacks everything. If the enemy is in minions, the character will attack minions rather than him. 6) Constant freezes! I have a top-of-the-line pc, all the new products go well, but why does this game constantly freezes at the beginning of the game? Why can't it be optimized for HDD? So that the game unloads textures during loading, and not when someone uses the ability. I can't install it on SSD, why should I suffer? 7) Different effects of skins! Unfortunately due to the fact that the game has too many skins and each of them has different effects, you sometimes just do not understand where the enemy attack. For example, I have Lux with a skin on my team. And something barely visible flies at me. Well, I thought that it's my Lux launched an attack and did not pay attention to it. But no! Turns out it was an enemy attack. Why couldn't it be added that all enemy attacks have a red effect and you know they are dangerous? 8) Deleting modes! Well, why remove cool game modes? When all developers are trying to diversify their game with content, league developers add temporary modes that are then removed. They could have created a normal create and search for player servers that would include these modes. I want to play odyssey so badly, but apparently it will never happen again.. 9) Give up! I just hate the possibility of giving up! Your whole team is losing, but you're playing great. You think you're going to start helping your team, get more gold and win easily, but then your team starts to give up. You press "no", but the game doesn't care! That's it, you've lost without a chance to win. Nothing depends on you! You're a nobody in this game! I end up tilting as soon as someone suggests giving up. Even if someone says no. I just realize that there is no point in trying to play well, because soon my allies will definitely surrender. That, by the way, was the final argument why I quit this game. I lost over 50 games just because my allies were giving up. As a result, when one of my allies died at the beginning of the game, I just stopped playing normally, because I was sure that my allies would surrender, there was no point in trying.

This game is particularly built to keep your energy consumed while it displays very little progress each year in development. As the game goes on you see it more. The only people who push out this game now are the loyal fanbase who's been playing for years which they've managed to lessen each year as well. If you look at their top streamers whom they endorsed two years ago, none of them are in the league anymore except for maybe a couple lol. Statistically, their player base has dropped in the past two years and that isn't a coincidence. Riot seems to lack the awareness of how bad their game has truly gotten and of course, they're not going to be aware. They don't have any system that requires them to be hands-on in their own game.

Been playing since 2010. Game has consistently gotten worse. Game is fun, community is toxic but it is what you make of it, if you dont like chat mute it. The worse thing is Riot. They mishandle everything. The thing in particular I am going to harp on is over policing chat. The slightest thing, that isn't malicious at all, like legit a joke that doesn't offend anyone at the time it is said will get you banned if one toxic player at the end of the games reports you or everyone just cause they are being toxic. You can hardly say anything anymore but somehow these players that literally rage everyone are just fine. Riot needs to do one of two or three things. One: Hardly ever ban or restrict anyone. Save it for the most extreme and egregious cases. I see all of this talk about making the game appropriate for people of all ages, yea right. You first riot. How about you remove some of your suggestive and very violent videos from the internet. Also how bout you stop and immediately remove all of your lewd and oversexualized skins and content from the game. And take away temmo's line "Size doesn't mean everything." We all know that's an innuendo. Two: Get rid of chat. We have pings and emotes to communicate, plenty of them. And with the dragon and baron voting thing its fine. We can talk to our boys (and lady friends) on discord. Your chat is a breeding ground of toxicity. Third: Make an update where you pretty much have everyone sign a waiver agreeing to take part in chat. Then every player starts the game muted and other players are muted. Every game. If you want to talk or listen, you can toggle unmute all or unmute the players you would like to. Stop being these censoring "woke" mindless drones.

a horrible game , filled with horrible people, first of all, whatever riot things theyr doing by removing features to "combat" toxicity, is blatendly stupid, if they actually played theyr game.. people at riot games who play, yone, briar and yasuo dont count, those people are brainless. if they actually played theyr game, they would see the problems, everywhere,from bugs to, balancing, toxicity is born when u neglect ur players, which riot has done every update, from 200 dollar skins to new champions who are meta for 3months, leaving old champions to rot in the pits of "troll picks" , the game is made in such a way, that if u even lost a single objective, its going to be hard for u to win or do anything for that matter, i mean, try killing briar when she has a item ahead of u, impossible , i get the team effort and aspect of the game, but most of the time, ur team doesnt exist, theyr doing theyr own thing, or theyr probably ai mascarading as human beings, becouse that 0/10 yasuo is either a toddler, which id understand, or a ai , mostly the ladder . and if u rly wanna fix your toxicity problem, stop adding champs, stop making overpriced skins with no effort behind them, hire a actual balancing team that doesnt play yone, briar , yasuo, and for the love of god let people say anything in champ without getting banned, i mean, if i say kys, im probably not going to the get chat restricted, but god forbid i say "good job guys" or im going straight to **** hell, for a multi billion dollar company , u guys cant even do stuff a indie company can, its not the money, its the stupidity that runs in those offices , im looking at u,CIO of adc's or whatever the **** he things he is, wed be better off without him,or the whole balancing team, if u want a team game, where people tryand are mostly nice to you, goo playdota, that game atleast lets u make mods , and have fun in those mods, some mods are even, singleplayer.. i know.. riot has feared that word forever, becouse it doesnt make money, **** u riot, please, with all do no respect, delete this game, start over, and maybe ur comunity wont be filled with fat degenerates without a life who cant seem to go outside in years becousethey have to hit plat or jade or whatever **** colors theyll be adding, ive played enough of the game to realise its rly not for me, the game focuses on one thing,greed, and greed alone, be the best or ull get stomped, which *cough cough* invites toxicity, items are just statsticks with extra steps, meanwhile a certain other moba that has items knows what items are for, to counter other champions, with tons of items being usefull for everyone, not just one specific champion, but will riot ever learn from this? no .. lmao, they never did, its been what.. 13 ? 14 years , and theyr game is still running on big rig raccing >with all love and respect, go kill urself *middle finger* to the CIO at the balance team, nobody will miss u

Giving this garbage game a solid 0/10. Deserved, since it is a long time not about making a good game anymore. The devs are just too lazy to fundamentally revamp the entire concept, which has outlived its lifespan by a large margin. The entire game design is fundamentally flawed, since it is based on tilt and not on teamplay. Riot expects to know better than the majority of nameful sociologists and psychologists of modern age, by claiming a team can instantly work together, skipping "forming" and "storming" phase and jump right into "performing" phase - in a situation where complex and organised actions are required and at the same time minor failures of an individual disrupt the game experience of everyone else. Also not to forget to mention the lack of champion balance, which is among the worst of every competitive MOBA, or any other competitive game ever created. Best and worse champions have more than 20% winrate difference ON AVERAGE - and it gets worse every season. I repeat: 20% - even 1% or 2% usually indicates that serious work has to be put into champion balance. And in this toxic environment Riot just expects players to just work. Criticism is not wanted. The players are suffering for Riot's greed, inability and general failure as a company that has no shame charging 25€ for a mediocre champion skin with slightly altered effects and doing nothing to protect the players from the biggest Threat itself: Riot and their own game.

The developer works on his game only in the media sphere. They have laid out new rules according to which violations can be punishable by a PC ban, but at the same time, once every 1-2 games you are GUARANTEED to come across someone engaged in soft int (deliberate trolling to speed up defeat, but without death from enemies, for example dancing in the enemy jungle ). The developers pretend that they have no problems, with new champions that are frankly broken by design, and are produced on a production line. With an unreal toxic that they encourage with donated cosmetics. With players who spam the “surrender” buttons 24/7. With a selection of players who, when your rank is “silver” and the win rate is 50-52%, throw the top 200 player of the server into your opponents. This game is so exhausting with its unresolved problems that you no longer have any strength for it.

The game has a really cool lore and many of the characters are interesting, the problem came from 2017 onwards where the game started to lose its strategic essence and became a button mashing game, most of the new characters come with a lot of crowd control , lots of dash, lots of damage and all the old champions that received nerfs for trivial things, look outdated and also useless compared to the overloaded kits of the new champions, some characters can put together a full cooldown kit and have a high damage ult that takes up a lot part of the map every 30s like Lux, other characters like Quyinna and Samira have absurd area damage, along with several other ways of avoiding damage (because many skillshots, especially from old characters) have a long cooldown and a low movement speed of the projectile, while you will wait 10s 15s for the next chance to use it, the shield, the dodge or even the wind barrier have already come back from cooldown a little earlier, this makes the game a sort of orchestrated business for toxicity, as if If it were Fortnite seen from above, where what matters is the frantic movement and information overload, with the high number of champions, the bans have become kind of useless, and the dangerous comps that can give up to 8 seconds of uninterrupted cc, or kill you before you get in range to take some action have become very common, I've been playing this game since 2012, but currently I have little desire, if a few years ago I played 10 games in a day, today I play one and already I'm saddened by the state of the game, from a strategy game to a team game based on short-term rewards, that's my vision of League of Legends, don't even think about playing ranked, it's a distillery of toxicity, the game's community it seems to be made up of backrubbers who will justify any action by RIOT as correct and direct the blame to those who notice the fractures in the structure of the game, if you haven't played it yet, try it, but don't spend your money, there are better things out there.

Actual trash game. Community wise the most trash delusional toxic players you'll ever see. They will give up, they will do whatever it takes to make you very angry and you will find out that Riot Games does not give a single **** about it. I'm not even joking you, Riot Games would rather ban you saying cuss words than your teammates running your games down 24/7. They have no idea what they are doing, which is why this is a game that has way more negatieve reviews than positive. They probably think it's the community, however they are a big part in their own problem. I would avoid Riot Games at all cost. They are an incompetent company and they really just make money off people's addiction. They go hand in hand with your passive-aggressive soft inting bastard teammates that know the system of Riot all too well and as a new player with some common sense you will receive the short end of the stick. Riot forces their bs beliefs onto you like they are your caretaker. Development wise it's also bad. They just release new champs and skins and do nothing new for the game. They added 2v2 gamemode after a decade... It's also trash.. Unbalanced and stops being fun very fast because of that.

League of Legends is more than just a game; it's a cultural phenomenon that has defined the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) genre for over a decade. Having played it since its inception, I can confidently say that League of Legends continues to captivate and innovate. The depth of gameplay is astounding. Each of the hundreds of champions offers a unique experience, and the ever-evolving meta keeps things fresh. The combination of teamwork, strategy, and individual skill is what makes this game truly competitive and endlessly replayable. The graphics have come a long way, and the constant stream of updates keeps them looking fresh. The rich lore and character design have solidified the champions as iconic figures in gaming history. However, it's not all roses. Toxicity within the community can be a problem, although the introduction of the honor system and the report feature has helped. And for newcomers, the learning curve can be steep, which may deter some from getting into the game. Nevertheless, League of Legends has withstood the test of time and remains one of the most played games in the world. It has not only reshaped the gaming industry but also influenced the eSports scene. Whether you're a veteran summoner or a newcomer, League of Legends is a must-play for anyone looking to experience the pinnacle of competitive online gaming. It's more than a game; it's a lifestyle. Rating: 9/10

Overall, it’s a good game with an awful community. The game: League of legends is a free-to play game that can be played with friends but can also be played alone. There are 3 main game modes in the game: Summoner's Rift, ARAM and Team Fight Tactics. They are all different, unique and have their own play style. Each game approximately lasts 30 - 45 minutes but it can vary due to the different levels of experience people have in the game. There is also a ranked feature for people who feel competitive and want to see how they are improving over time. It is a fun strategic game however the fun factor can be taken away by toxic teammates. The community: If I had to describe the community in one word, it would be toxic. If you are new to the game, you should be ready for getting hated on more than ever before in your life. The community is racist, homophobic and just simply consists of the worst people. There is a reporting system that can get people banned, however it is not good enough. More than 50% of the games I have been in, there was at least one toxic player ruining the game for the rest of the team members. Gameplay: Most games modes are 5v5. At the beginning of the game each player selects a champion that they want to play with. Each champion has unique abilities and different play styles which makes each game different and more interesting. The aim of the game is to destroy the enemy “Nexus” and defend your own by working together with your team. The controls are very simple. The movement of the character is controlled by right clicking on the mouse, and the different abilities of the champion are controlled by the ‘Q’, ‘W’, ‘E’ and ‘R’ keys. Champions: Another big fault with the game is that the champions are unbalanced. A champion can one-shot you and there is nothing you can do about it, while your champion could never one-shot the enemy. This takes away from the fun factor so much as it makes people feel like they can’t play the game as they are dead non-stop. There are regular updates and patches to try and make the game overall more balanced by changing little bits about different champions. Graphics and sound: The graphics is mid. Not the best graphics you have ever seen but it also isn't the worst thing to look at. However, this is good because it means it doesn’t require the best PC in the world to play the game. The sound design in my opinion is really good. Some abilities create sound for everyone on the enemy team as a warning. There are different voice tracks for each champion which links to their background (what their life was like before they started fighting) and also their abilities. The overall sounds in the game create an amazing atmosphere.

Truly one of the best games to have ever been made, League of Legends has gone through many iterations since release, though it has remained on a downward trend throughout most of them. The game hit a peak in quality a few years after release and has since been dealing with extreme power and mobility creep to the point of becoming one of the single most unbalanced games on the market. With staggeringly large entry-barriers and the single most toxic playerbase of any game in history, this MOBA is one to avoid.

Pésimo juego... cada día me voy dando mas cuenta que a la mayoría de la gente le gusta la mrda.. Gráficamente es horrible, solo logra escudarse de su apariencia colorida lo cual para muchos es agradable, pero visualmente es pésimo. La comunidad es extremadamente toxica y se sienten lo mejor del mundo.. cuando en realidad toda la gente que juega esto son g0rd@s sin vida, que no se bañan y se la pasan jugando unas 8 o 12 horas diarias. Dentro del juego en si, me resulta bastante sencillo a comparación de otros del genero, donde la mayoría de los items solo tienen efectos pasivos y las habilidades de los campeones son fáciles de entender (también en su mayoría), si bien esto para gente que apenas este comenzando en el genero de los MOBA esta perfecto, a la larga el LOL se siente como algo muy repetitivo, monótono y que todas las partidas son lo mismo. Otro punto negativo es el sistema para desbloquear a los Campeones, si bien puedes obtenerlos con monedas del juego, existen varios algo costosos y tomando en cuenta que son mas de 100 personajes es algo molesto tener que meter dinero real para obtener campeones... Tal vez dentro de lo único bueno que le veo al juego es su estudio Riot Games el cual es muy bueno para hacer publicidad.

This game is terrible all around. The core game is fine; the moba aspect is okay its not that great especially considering the core gameplay has not changed at all + nonexistent vision of what league as a game should be. Community: Toxic at casual play, all levels of ranked and most certainly present in competitive big name high level players. Cash Cow: Riot makes skins and bundles for revenue and as long as it works they dont care about anything else. Make 1 billion skins for lux + some organ destroying skin for miss fortune, katarina or irelia. Toxicity: Riot wants the game to be toxic. The toxic community is what gets them revenue. The hardcore keyboard warriors that will call you every slurr just for not helping them try to 1v3. The toxicity has gotten WORSE over the years RECCOMENDATION: Do not play this game. It is a chore. It is not fun, the only emotion you will feel is relief after winning your first match after losing the last 20. You could run three companies simultaneously and be less stressed than playing this dogwater game.

Most always you get some bots in a team and then once you say them they are bad, they'll just report you and you will get penaltys. For Riot it does not matter if you are performing best in a team, they will just get you penalties, because you are unpolite.

Worst community ever. This game is pretty fun when you start playing. However, after a handful of games faulty game mechanics begin to surface making more and more games very one-sided. The matchmaking system is based on a so called 'ELO-rating' which should be an indicator of 'how good you are'. However, this system is only based on games won and games lost. I can safely say that 15 out of 20 games are one-sided slaughterfests, where one team completely dominates the other team (ie. the one team has at least 4 times more kills then the other, leaving that team overfed and the losing team has almost 0% chance to come back from it). Furthermore, if you do get a 'fair' matchup based on the average ELO of your team and the opposing team, you will still be pitted against teams who have way more wins on average than you have. This means that, if the matchmaking system finally puts you against people with around the same ELO, you can still lose pretty badly because the other team simply has more games played and thus way more experience with the game.

Riot game with its 200 years of balanced experience has created the worst moba game of all time, all in this game is a mess of gameplay, ranks, events and toxic community. I've been playing the game since season 1 and it did the best to deliver the same horrible experience as their game making experience. about champions, the design is very stupid, Irelia is extremely imba with only one Blade of the Ruined King item, even though you won the lane against it (there is also a meme 1 champ full item lost when confronting Irelia 1 item.Equipment when changing in a season it will obviously have a very OP item and all players simply spam it constantly causing the game to lose balance, and it's been so many seasons that always repeating like that is unwritten law. As for the boring event, they only focus on designing skins to increase revenue. Rank every time they edit, they rank with deviation, then hacking/ The cheating tool, game breaking, dirty buffs are still showing up regularly, there is still no solution in general, it is a bad game

Where to begin... Ah, yes, League of Legends. A game that seems to be crafted solely to test your patience and steal every ounce of joy from your face. Imagine having a choice between watching grass grow and installing this game. Watching grass grow suddenly sounds quite appealing. If you love the feeling of helplessness and frustration, this is the game for you. It all starts with selecting a character, which is probably the toughest decision you'll make in the game. Why, you ask? Because there's always, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, that one person on your team who decides to play a new character they've never touched before, and during a ranked match, of course! Sure, they'll die more times than there are lines in a Shakespearean sonnet, but at least they'll die in style, right? The beginning of the match is a true delight – you get to experience what it's like to be utterly clueless and completely helpless. The enemies seem to know what they're doing, and your allies move around like drunken ostriches. And the best part, you receive some truly insightful messages from fellow players. "Go there and die," "Why are you even playing if you're so bad?" and "Are you a bot?" are just a few of the gems you'll hear. Have you ever wondered what it's like to have a fishing rod with a long, rubbery stick on one end and a hyperactive fish on the other end, constantly jumping in different directions? That's exactly what a fight in League of Legends looks like. And let's not forget about the ranking system, which seems to be designed based on the principle of "the more you play, the lower your rank gets." Isn't that just splendid? To sum it up, League of Legends is a game that can evoke feelings of helplessness, frustration, and the urge to scream at the world. If you're ready to sacrifice your nerves for virtual battles, then this game is for you. Otherwise, we recommend making a hard-boiled egg instead – it'll be less stressful, and at least you'll have some sustenance at the end.

Al principio parece un juego divertido, y durante las primeras partidas lo es, hasta que se vuelve un juego super desbalanceado, que pudiendo jugar otros del género, League of Legends deja mucho que desear. El peor aspecto del juego, es la comunidad, llena de gente troll o que directamente no sabe como funciona, por lo que si no tienes un equipo ya hecho (con tus amigos por ejemplo) se vuelve imposible jugar, es cierto que no es culpa del juego en si, pero al ser un juego multijugador, es importante remarcarlo. Su otro problema es la falta de modos de juego, además del principal, existen otros 3, y con lo que gana Riot, podrían esmerarse más

I began playing this game in Season 3 Season 3: Good Season 4: Good Season 5: Bad Season 6: Good Season 7: Bad Season 8: Good Season 9: Bad Season 10: Good Season 11: Good Season 12: Good Season 13 is probably the worst season to date. Pros: - Playing casually with friends is the most fun I can have in this game, anything else makes it a mental drain and a chore. - The Durability rework in Season 12 was one of the best decisions Riot have made. Unfortunately the game now feels like a low TTK mess where in the games are more or less over in the first 12 minutes. Cons: - New champions are NEVER fun to play against. They are poorly balanced and take away 1-2 bans from ranked games when there are continuously more champions being added. - New champions are being added when the other new champions are still lacking balance. - The matchmaking is horrendous. There is never a situation in which the game isn't a complete one sided stomp. - The roles aren't balanced. Jungle clearly has the most impact in the game and your chances of losing or winning highly depend on this. - Soft inting is clearly acceptable by Riot's standards as they make no effort to punish this

0/10 points no discussions. to those clowns here, who claim just to "mute everyone": This is supposed to be a team game. Defaulting in muting everyone shows a severe flaw in the state of the game. It is Riot's responsibility to make the game less tilting and less toxic. Nobody expects players to get rid of their human emotions. If they can sell a skin for 25$ without shame they surely should be able to find a way of making the game less frustrating and overall improve the game quality.

Other than the community, this game is a MOBA masterpiece. I've been playing it for 10+ years and have no regrets. Mute the enemy team, and your experience improves tenfold. Mute your team, and the experience will be enhanced twenty-fold. Unmute your enemies and your team, and mute yourself; your experience improves a hundred-fold. LOL And do notice that most of the negative reviews show mental weakness and/or the inability to manage personal/individual frustration. Food for thought!

There are 4 different "quality levels" when judging games. good games - games that are good ok games - games that are ok bad games - games that are terrible riot games - games that are to bad that even bad games look so terrible compared to them, so that a new category is required to differentiate. usually Riot games all come from the company "Riot Games", since they consistently produce games on "Riot games" leve quality League is obviously a Riot game and is rated "Riot games" which makes them 0/10 rating, as long 0 is the lowest rating you can go. Ratings might adjusted once negative numbers are added to the scale.

If there was ever a discussion whether big gaming companies should be legally charged due to emotional damage and false advertising, this could be the precedence. Even to modern standards, where you have to swallow much as a customer, Riot still finds a way to hit you below the belt: Game design, pricing, customer support quality, balance. Everything and more is executed subpar and an insult to what the game could be if managed properly.

Probably one of the worst games you can play. It's addictive and fun, but the community is probably full of the most toxic people you will ever meet. Every game has at least one person feeding, griefing or just being a horrible human being. Unfortunately Riot cares more about money than creating a positive game environment, so don't expect anything to change. It's been like this for over 6 years (since i started playing) and I am giving up and deleting this garbage game. Do yourself a favor and don't even try this game.

Puede ser un juego muy divertido para jugarlo, pero tiene muchos problemas relacionados sobre todo con la comunidad que lo juega y se puede hacer hasta frustrante por ella. También, las partidas son bastante largas y quizá eso hace el juego algo menos accesible para la gente. Eso si, el juego tiene requisitos muy bajos y casi todos los ordenadores lo soportan perfectamente. Hay muchos personajes y miles de formas de jugar, aunque entrar en el juego se hace un poco difícil por todas las variables de características que hay. La interfaz del menú es algo complicada sobre todo al principio, aunque luego se pueda llegar a entender. Si este juego no te acaba provocando adicción, acaba siendo una opción muy disfrutable que siempre te va a mantener entretenido cuando no sepas que hacer. 6,9/10 (08/2019)

The game unfortunately is not fun anymore. I have been playing since season 1, but not extensively.

The game is fun to start playing. Made a few friends playing this game but most of them have since moved on from this game. After a few hours of it, you start to realize that they explicitly favor some characters over others this can be seen in how they "patch" the game and which characters get skins. I wish they put as much effort into their cinematics as they did in making the game fair and entertaining. Plus this game is riddled with smurfs making the experience terrible.

Although LoL has come out with many rotating game modes over the past decade, with some becoming permanent branches of the main game, I am only focusing on the 5v5 game played on the Summoners Rift map, which used to be LoL in its entirety. On the Summoners Rift map, each player is put into a pool with four other players unless they are playing in a premade game with friends, which would lessen the number of random players in the lobby. The different roles in LoL are the Top, Jungle, Mid, Bot/ADC, and Support. Each roll has a specific job within each match, with many players tending to specialize in only one or two roles in their entire history with LoL. Once players have their roles, they pick a Champion to play as. LoL has over 140 Champions to choose from, each with unique abilities and playstyle. However, each Champion can usually only fit one or two class styles: Assassin, Fighter, Mage, Marksman, Support, and Tank. Each Champion also has the same default controls, with the player views them from a 3rd person perspective, looking down on them from above. The game is typically played with a mouse and keyboard. The main objective of Summoners Rift is to destroy the opposing team’s Nexus. However, the base is guarded by powerful stationary, stone turrets protected by constant waves of minions. The main gameplay is to kill opponent minions and Champions to gain experience points (XP) which are used to level your Champion and gold to buy items. As a Champion gains levels, their base stats increase, and they can improve one of their abilities, with the max level attainable being 18. Gold is used to acquire items in the shop at a player’s base; items increase a Champions base stats and can give additional abilities. There are over 200 unique items in LoL, but the maximum amount of items a Champion can hold is 6. When a Champion is killed, they have a revive timer, depending on if the game is in its early, mid, or late game stages. Communication can be the most enjoyable aspect of the game when playing LoL with friends, sitting in the same room with you, or chatting on a voice call. Warning your friend about an approaching enemy, playfully teasing them when they make an outrageous mistake that leads to their Champion’s death, or just bursting out in laughter at them landing a killing blow against the odds is what can make playing LoL a timeless experience. However, when playing with strangers online, that same teamplay aspect can make LoL a painful experience. Even though LoL doesn’t have a voice channel for casual play, there is still text chat. I have often made just one simple mistake, and suddenly my entire team is belittling me, calling me slurs, and demanding I uninstall the game. Opponents can also be quite toxic towards you and put you down and call you “trash” and the like. LoL’s gameplay can be very entertaining, especially once you get the hang of at least one Champion and start showing off your skills. However, LoL’s steep learning curve does hinder most beginners. It took me around 2 years to get my head around the mechanics within LoL, and my primary motivation was playing it so I could bond with my older brother more. Without an underlying reason to master the game, many players trip over its mechanics and end up being kicked by some toxic player and call it quits there. LoL excels when played with friends as they can act as a cushion against the struggles presented by the game in its complexity and the potential heckling of the other team. However, without the safety net of friends, the LoL community is just not a welcoming place that has often made me quit a match in disgust, or even though we might end a game with a victory, I’ll end up feeling less than myself. If one can get past the toxic community of League of Legends, the game itself is delightful to play. Each match doesn’t take excessive time, and proving to your opponents and teammates your successes within the game can be a thrilling experience. Learning a new role, class style, or Champion can be an exciting challenge. Experimenting with building different items on a Champion can be a journey of creativity and problem-solving. Working with strangers to complete the common goal of destroying the enemies’ Nexus can be a fulfilling endeavor that bleeds into working with others in your day-to-day life. I ultimately come back to LoL because I can bond over something familiar with my brother and friends. But even without them and facing the toxicity of my teammates and opponents, LoL is still a fun game to overcome complex challenges.

I love this game with all my heart. I have played it for over 10 years now and has extreme sentimental value to me. Due to frequent updates the game stays fresh and the meta shifts around every now and then. This can also be seen as a problem, sometimes things change for the worse to make the game absolutely unplayable and unfun for a while. Even though I have left a couple of times, I have always come back as it keeps **** me in. Multiple gamemodes (even though RIOT has not brought many of their best ones back), ranked and normal play are always very easy to queue into. The biggest problem in this game is its community. It is extremely toxic and makes the game hard to get into without feeling like you are the worst player in the world. It shouldn't be normal to have to mute chat when you are learning a game. if you really want to get into this game, just turn chat off or play with friends so you can focus on eachother. Smurfing is a big problem as well I have heard in lower levels but can not confirm as I have not been there in years. I love this game, the gameplay is amazing and the amount of champions makes basically every game feel fun. The multiple roles means that you can basically play for an extreme amount of hours to master everything or simply 1 to master that one.

League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena game developed by Riot Games that has taken the gaming world by storm. With over 100 million active players each month, it's easy to see why it's one of the most popular games in the world. Pros: Diverse roster of champions with unique abilities and playstyles, providing endless replayability. Deep and strategic gameplay that requires teamwork and strategy to succeed. Thriving community of players who are always ready to welcome new players. Established as a leading esport, with a huge competitive scene and major international tournaments. Cons: Harsh and unforgiving ranking system. Persistent issue with toxic behavior from some players. Despite its flaws, League of Legends is still a fantastic game that is a must-play for fans of the MOBA genre. With constant updates and new content being added, this game will keep you entertained for countless hours. The diverse roster of champions and deep, strategic gameplay make it a game that you can play for years to come. League of Legends is also a leading esport, with a huge competitive scene and major international tournaments that draw in millions of viewers. This adds another level of excitement to the game and provides players with the opportunity to watch and learn from the best players in the world. Overall, I would give League of Legends a 9 out of 10. While the ranking system and persistent issue with toxic behavior can be frustrating for some players, the game's diverse roster of champions, deep, strategic gameplay, and thriving esports scene more than make up for these shortcomings. If you're looking for a deep and engaging MOBA experience, League of Legends is definitely worth checking out.

Game I've been playing too long because friends kept at it out of nostalgia. It's a dumbed down MOBA with a low skill ceiling, no strategy and mechanics suited only to making snowballing and comebacks viable as a way to make matches artificially hype. The game balance has been trash for its entire existence in spite of frequent patches because the incompetent balance team only cares about creating forced metas. The community might just be the absolute worst bunch of griefers and pansies you can meet in an online game, made only worse by the fact they can and will ruin your games on a whim. Nothing is done about them, but they will treat you like a **** for saying anything you wouldn't say in church. I regret every minute and cent spent on this garbage fire **** and I wish I played Tekken in that time instead.

With every new champion I realize how degenerate this company is. LGB (not yet T, thank God for that) is the main ideology pushed in and by this game. Also the new song released by Lil Nas X, is being used as the anthem for LoL Championship. It shows how bad this company is. Besides that major problem and extremely high level of trolls (because Riot Games doesn't care about trolls, they only care about people who are toxic) the game is kind of fun. I would strongly recommend looking for alternatives in the future though.

First of all, I don't even bother to play ranked, it simply isn't worth it, it just stresses and not even the skin for Gold elo is worth the stress, IMO. That said, every time I've entered in the queue I don't know if the next match I will have fun or I'll only get frustated. There are matches that are really funny, when I play Fizz and make a cool play or play Chogath or Quinn and got really fed, it is cool. Also, there are exciting matches that are very balanced and you have to play well to win. But there are also terrible matches, where you get fu**ed, sometimes the enemy Jungle camps you or the game is just unbalanced and your team is literally r*ped, there are also trolls and anything like that and the fact that you can't quit the game or you will be punished is REALLY frustrating.

Riot Games and Tencent have been sued multiple times for gender discrimination ($100m settlement), defamation, noncompliance with laws protecting minors (Beijing), money laundering, and received antitrust fines.

You can write many essays why this game doesn't worth your time, just listing some of bad points about this game: 1. Extremely toxic community that Riot does so little it doesn't matter, you are guaranteed to have at least one toxic teammate 2/3rd of times 2. Almost nonexistent moderation. you report clear violations (people love to afk at base or under tower) and you can easily catch and punish them with simple algorithms but no, you have to endure full game and it's not fun 3. Pay2Win. It's extremely hard to get enough BE to buy champions freely, you could play everyday for a month and barely unlock 1 champion unless you are willing to pay. 4. Unless you have 2-3 friends to play with you, never waste your time in single queue, you will NEVER have fun since every single game you find a toxic person in your comp. I kinda don't blame them, Riot purposefully hurts its players to the point they become toxic too, they run psychological experiments on the players, like animals (just Google it) 5. I gave it 1 because it has nice skins and story, nothing else

There is so much champions but riot don't want balance YI is just spamming Q key on keyboard this is second problem unbalanced champions also bel'veth is so OP now this is why I playing ARAM because you getting random champions at this mode. There is so much to change but game is really funny if you have team or just play ARAM less toxic players. For beginners I recommend: yummi, pyke, bel veth,jhin, nasus. 5/10 is just: good and bad game 50/50

The game itself is very bad. In most games it is not your own performance that makes you win, but the luck of not getting trolling teammates. There is a general rule of thumb widely accepted by the best LoL-players in the world: You can't win a game alone, but you can lose one alone. This means it is enough for only 1 player out of your teammates to troll, but no matter how hard you try you can't compensate it with the power of your own. Realizing this it gets a very bitter taste, that essentially it is a coinflip simulator. Everything comes up for youto get the physically, mechanically and mentally more stable team, if you don't, then it is best not to waste more time in this particular game. Ofc this undeniable truth quickly spreads and therefore you maybe have heard the common phrase "open mid", used when one team realizes it lost that particular coinflip, but the game does not let you surrender before a certain timestamp in the game. You are effectively "held hostage" by a game, which advertises to be "competitive and fun". In the end it is up to you, if you give it a try. I can only recommend that you do not. You will certainly face scenarios described above much more often than you ever wish.

Advertised as "competitive team game" there are more lies than actually words in this phrase. You have no team, you have a bunch of guys flaming at the first occasion they get. It is also not competitive, because of the completly neglected balance and the coinflippy nature of the matchmaking system. And - which is the sadest part - it is not even a real game. In a game you would get fair conditions from the very start with an intention to bring you joy while playing, ye well this is far from reality. Well deserved 0/10

There are plenty of other games, stay away from this one, it's addicting but based on your negative emotions: 1. Disgusting community 2. There is almost no system in place to catch trolls (fake placebo reports) 3. Most games are made up of higher rank recycled players smurfing on lower accounts 4. Matchmaking is probably the worst in any MOBA game (also because of smurfs) 5. The client is a mess, bugs, crashes, after > 10 years of development and "200 years combined experience" 6. Balancing does not really exist, it's just a ping-pong between what skin should sell more, or what champion should be bought more. 7. The community is "muted" - do not expect anything that the community actually enjoys to be implemented. PS: I started playing in 2010, ranked peak Diamond, the game that I used to enjoy is gone, this is something else. Goodbye League of Flamers and Trolls.

I will be subjectively describing what I have experienced during my time playing League of Legends. Everything is from my point of view, but it is the truth from the knowledge I have and meant as it is written. The game itself is over 10 years olf and has not aged well. I have seen the development over the years and in retrospective I can say that every action made to tackle a problem or improve the current situation was sub-optimal, not clearly thought through, made by someone who either does not know or does not care - or most likely both. Problem 1: Too many champions. It is impossible to balance every combination of such a mass of abilities. But instead of making champions "seasonal", which is a common well-workin approach, Riot decided to do: Nothing. Problem 2: The community have become increasingly toxic. Back in the day chat messages were read by humans (player on voluntary basis) and then it was decided if actions need to be made. At some point they decided, that this was too much work or this could be made "cheaper", so they introduced an automated system. This is working terribly. People quickly figured out how to be toxic under the radar. A secret "code" established where some words actually meant different words, but everyone exactly understood the toxic intention behind it. Riot's reaction: Nothing. Chats are still automatically analyzed, they tweaked it in a very poor way that people automatically get a punishment if they simply write "too much" or get reported by too many people - independantly if there was anything punishable written. Problem 3: insanely bad balance, stale champions and little housekeeping. As mentioned in above, there are too many champions (almost 160 at the time of writing). The best champions peak at an average winrate of like 57% and the worst sometimes drop to 36%. The gap of 20% is insane. Comparable games already have been declared out of control if the gap passes the 5% mark. But Riot maintains a solid 20% gap. At some point in time they even said "Sorry, we are uncapable of balancing this champion, we are focussing on other stuff." And these are the words of multi-million dollar company, not some hobby-garage start up. it is expected that champion balance will keep decreasing over the time as more and more new champions are introduced. Problem 4: The issue with "ranked-boosting" In this game everyone wants to flex with a high rank. Therefore a black market has developed where high level players offer a service of "boosting" an account to a certain ranked rating in exchange for money. This market is flourishing for nearly a decade now. Riot claims to have it under control, but in fact this is a blunt lie. In nearly every ranked games there is at least someone involved who does not deserve to be there or you are facing a booster. Riot's reaction is once again: Nothing. Problem 5: Smurfs Many experienced players want the feeling of destroying someone and provoking and flexing. Therefore they create new accounts and play with new or inexperienced or simply players much worse than they normally play with. These ofc gets these players frustrated since they don't even understand what is happening there. Often I have read that new players quit league after one or two games because of their negative experience with smurfs. Conclusion: Riot games Inc. is a **** company, mostly focussing on milking the customer in every way possible. The actual problems of the game are ignored. Most likely the plan is to ride the dead horse as long as it creates money. There is no future for this game. I strongly recommend not to play this game at all.

Peaking at a new all time low every season when the gets worse. Every new champion they release is worse than the one before... at some point they managed to break the balance to a point of no return. Winrates of the best and the worst champs are nearly 20% apart of each other. Riot made a pretty clear call with this: "We are incapable of maintaining this game any longer, we squeeze out all the money we can get as long as we have a good game name to sell".

So apparently there is this thing called "eloboosting" - that is when you pay someone (better) to play ranked games on your account to climb up the ranked ladder. The problem starts when those people who pay the others resume playing on the level they did not earn by themselves, since they get absolutely obliterated and make the game less fun for everyone. Apparently League of Legends has a HUUUUUGE issue with eloboosting (literally 2-3 players in every game). But Riot Games does not seem to set their priorities right - since boosted players still buy skins. Anyway I think I have had my share dealing with those kind of people often enough. I am out for good!

Well what can I say: I wished I never had started this game. Every second is clearly the opposite of fun. Every champ is either useless or overpowered. Once you figure out that Riot's first priority is to make money and that this does not align well with "making a good game" you get more and more frustrated. If you really have to play a MOBA in 2022, then go for DotA, but not LoL.

There are major issues with this game in its current form. One ist definetly that there are too many champions and Riot lacks the competence to balance them well. Games get very frustrating, because your own performance seems to have little impact on the outcome. The other problem is definelty player behavior. There is a chat control system, but this is merely the tip of the iceberg and does not necessarily punishes the people who are the real problem.

The thing is: There are plenty of users - most of them toxic. If you are a long time player it might stil be the goto game for you. But never ever I would recommend this game to a new player. This game can be the cause of a serious depression, since it has all the negative aspects that a MOBA comes along including the infamous "hostage taking" where you are kept in a game with peopl you don't like and who are constantly flaming you. While this is true also for other games it is worth mentioning that you find the lowest class of human garbage in league of legend games. Being caged with these kind of people can cause serious health issues since their toxicity can't always be muted. They grief the **** out of you just with "legal methods", which Riot just refuses to adress. Take my advice: Go somewhere else, you will find only despair here.

The main problem with this game is the company behind it and their priorities. At some point they stopped caring about the game and focussed on generating money only. While they were creating skins and all the other cosmetic **** the game eroded. New champs are pooly designed and poorly balanced and dont fit very well within the older champions. But instead of working on that and the fact that it is merely impossible to balance 160 champions at the same time they just throw new content at it. By now they surely must have realized that the game is beyond saving so they pull as much money out of it as possible. Someone made the comparison of Riot with **** germany one day. Not very far off... bot in mentality and respect I have for both.

There are many Pro and Cons, the main ones: Game is fun with friends playing causally. If you play solo prepare to get disappointed/frustrated as there are many trolls/team griefers. Ranked is very competitive and often the playerbase is very toxic and abusive to bad performances. The graphic just got updated so it's pretty nice.

This game can get you highly depressed, if you play it solo, and even worse, solo ranked. if you haven't touched it, well, bless you. DO NOT EVER TOUCH THIS GAME SOLO (unless you have good friends and only play as a team, really, stay away from this game). Rated it 2 and not 0 just because the game itself is decent; however, it's far from flawless. Very, very far from it, and considering the amount of players worlwide, it should be the MAIN goal given to the devs. Really far from being achieved. I rated it 2, cause the game itself is actually decent; but the way it's built made the community toxic. That's the truth: it's the only massively online game based on teamwork which has the most toxic community I've ever seen, and I'm playing for 2 decades now. Which means people are not that toxic; but accumulated frustration made it so. And I have the feeling devs are OK with that, which I can't allow.

Join forces with your closest allies as you unite to defeat your foes in deadly multiplayer battle arenas. League of Legends combines elements from both strategy and role playing games to bring you a unique and dynamic player experience. As a Summoner, you will have your own distinct, customizable avatar that grows in power as you move through the game. In each battle you will select and call forth one of dozens of Champions to control and engage in head-to-head combat against teams of highly trained warriors. Choose your allies wisely, for the stakes are high. In the League, every battle means more than life or death as the balance of power shifts with each victory or defeat.

TLDR: The amount of frustration you receive playing this game can never be outweighed by the positive aspects of the game itself. Protect your family and friends from ever starting this game. Have been playing this game for the better part of ten years now. I have seen all up and downs so far and my objective conclusion is: The game has passed its zenit long time ago. The community gets worse every season, so is the balance. Competitive games are either infested with smurfs or eloboosted players (eloboosting= letting someone better play on your account in exchange for money to get to a ranked rating, where you do not belong. Eventually ruining the fun for everyone in the game). Riot is just overwhelmed in doing anything against, because they are either too busy to sell overpriced cosmetic stuff or making the game worse by rolling the dice when it comes to champion attributes and skills. They have system that automatically bans toxic players, but it is so poorly designed that it not necessarily targets the real culprits, who ruin the fun. The game mechanic itself creates tilt all over the place, when it forces you to play alongside players who either systematically sabotage you or flaming the **** out of you, while you are held hostage in a game with players you do not want to play with - think about it. It has an addictive character, but it rather feels like heroin, you will stop experiencing joy when playin g it, yet you will still always come back to it. If you have the chance: Stay away from this game, I seriously mean it. There are so much better games, which in the end do not let you think that you wasted your entire evening for nothing. And @Riot Games Inc. : GO **** YOURSELF.

In every single game one player makes a bad play or a mistake and the rest of the team starts blaming him, verbaly abuse him, go die on purpose, disconnect, refuse to play etc disruptive behavior and the game becomes unenjoyable and keeps you hostage till it's over in 30+ minutes, unless you are lucky and surrender at 15 minute. This is very annoying especially on competitive mode, as it keeps players from climbing. RIOT is unable to control the community, which has become the worst there is in video games. 0/10, I would give negative score if I could...

They broke the balance of the game. Even the tank is already shot by some supports. The victory does not depend on you, but who will have more noobs in the team. 4 years ago I was a grandmaster and now it's disgusting to play

Its a great game if you just play top or mid lane and play op champs because the op champs tend to be fun as well like zed or yasuo.

Нет никакого баланса, слишком часто выходят новые герои, из-за чего мета меняется со скоростью пули. Пояснение: Мордекайзер имеет 2 способности, направлены прямо (одна притягивает, другая дамажит), имея эти 2 способности он просто бьет тебя и рядом стоящих крипов и вносит миллион урона, также у него есть аура что замедляет и наносит урон(замедление настолько сильное, что не помогают предметы на скорость передвижения) и ульта, которая полностью ограничивает тебя от твоих союзников. По игре еще можно сказать, что камбэк просто не возможен, малейшее преимущество и ты ничего не можешь сделать. И мое любимое-кнопка сдаться, ее все жмут как только вашу команду убили 1 раз. Рекомендую просто не играть в это игру, если она скачена, то удалите(лучше саморазвитие или играйте в другие игры)

First of all, I don't even bother to play ranked, it simply isn't worth it, it just stresses and not even the skin for Gold elo is worth the stress, IMO. That said, every time I've entered in the queue I don't know if the next match I will have fun or I'll only get frustated. There are matches that are really funny, when I play Fizz and make a cool play or play Chogath or Quinn and got really fed, it is cool. Also, there are exciting matches that are very balanced and you have to play well to win. But there are also terrible matches, where you get fu**ed, sometimes the enemy Jungle camps you or the game is just unbalanced and your team is literally r*ped, there are also trolls and anything like that and the fact that you can't quit the game or you will be punished is REALLY frustrating.

Nice idea in general. However, they want you to suffer. You can't communicate well with your teammates just with chat and pings(without voice). Moreover, the game always matches u with 4 teammates who don't have a clue how the game is played. Not to mention how broken some champs are. Definitely wouldn't recommend if u want to live a sane, happy life without stress and time-wasting.

The obvious biggest flaw within the game is the community, as mentioned by so many people before me, but that has nothing to do with the game itself, or my score. Riot Games did not create the community of the game, as developers really have no control over that. The gameplay is well crafted, and with the large pool of Champions to choose from, you have many ways to play the game. Or at least you should. The biggest flaw on this game within the bound's of Riot's control is the system for unlocking new Champions. gaining the materials needed to unlock a Champion come with each level, but it gets harder to level up over time, as it requires more experience. When choosing a Champion to unlock, you become flustered, knowing it will become harder and harder to get any of the Champions you don't decide to buy when you finally have enough "Blue Essence" to unlock one of your choosing. This makes the game stale after some time, and just plain not enjoyable when you mix this system with the repetitive gameplay. Without the slow moving character unlocking system, this could be a great online game, that players can have fresh experiences with each Champion they unlock.

League was really good since 2017 but now it's entirety ****. Devs are really incompetent that they don't know how to balance champions. There is a 1 shot 1 kill and you can't react very fast enough because of that, and also there is a smurf issue in the game but RIOT don't give a **** about it. The ranking system is very terrible. If you win, you gain 15 points but if you lose, you loss 17 points. Overall **** MOBA I ever played.

Prepare to play a "Team" game where communication is non-existent and all you see is flame. Dont try to say anything to anyone or you get banned just because RIOT knows you will make a new account and buy skins over and over again. Also prepare to see the same 5 champs over and over again because all of the budget goes to their pockets instead of balancing the game. Stay away from it.

Been playing this game for years and i have loved nearly every second. A mayor downpour is that the community is bad which is ofc bad for the game, but it is not even close to being as impactful as people say it is. And after all there is a mute button to remove the biggest problem for the game. The gameplay is amazing when you learn to play, it's so enjoyable to play. It gives you both the opportunity to be a "casual" and a "tryhard". most of these people that review haven't even tried the game in it's fullest. I would personally say another problem is how it's extremely addicting and you really want to improve all the time.

After not playing this game for a number of years I decided to hop back on for the hell of it. I was quickly reminded of why I stopped playing to begin with. Team-based moba's are always going to be a mixed bag, but League just takes that negative and highlights it to its maximum potential. You will never have consistency in level of play unless you're playing with friends, whoever is left actually playing this relic. Beyond that this game has "evolved" to a point that it's almost impossible to get back into. I have no idea who the new characters or what they do and to be honest, I don't think this game is worth the hundreds of hours you would have to pour into it that would be necessary to reach an average skill level. Sure, you can say it offers more than it used to, but I liked it better when the game didn't have a million champs to worry about learning and an ever-changing shop/item system that will take a bit on its own to master. In short, this ain't worth the time and effort (moba's usually aren't)

League of Legends is insanely huge, it's one of the most successful and popular games of all time for good reasons. It's a fantastic game, very fun to play with a rich lore, phenomenal character design, great music and creative ideas, unfortunately brought down by its own toxic community and development team. There are so many fascinating gameplay mechanics but the balancing issues are very obvious from a mile away. And it's worth to mention that the learning curve is pretty high, so a newcomer might not enjoy it very much. Final Rating: "Amazing" ~ 9/10.

Old review from 2011. 6/10, This game have a problem, and not just one. League has great potential, some times when you play you had so much fun, that you don't mind not about lousy crashes at servers, not about huge balances issues in champions design and mode challenge, not about moron(s) with you had to play previously game, not about over priced content that offer this game. You just play and have fun, true fun. But when you start new game, and all these issues comes back, and you haven't getting fun anymore you wanna stop this for god sake. Another thing that developers almost every week make some change in balance, that comes in increasing and decreasing champions and items stats, some times changes is good some times it's can make your favorite champion just useless. All league players know such pains in ass who fall down so much that become just not a "good" choice to play at all. One more thing is community, is not growth enough, and i mean not only by the age in my point of view, too many rage, crying, and morons you meet, some times not. I know that in almost every online game, but still. So game is worth a 10 from 10 point, but the issues of the League keep me from that score. Review from 2021. 9/10. After 10 years of playing from time to time and with recent release of Arcane, i just must change rating from 6 to 9. Why 9 you ask me? Because they show that there is always way to to improve. This is the game which you come back from time to time and have fun.

I love this game it's great! However the new characters ruin the game as they are far too overpowered when they come out so that people spend money on them. And the main part that ruins this game is the community. The community is so toxic I've never seen anything like it. I accidentally stole someone's kill which actually saved them and then they spammed the n word in chat the whole game. Then another player in that game mistook me for saying the bad words and decided that if he saw me in real life, he would murder me. while the other half of my team had everyone muted and we're trying to tell me to mute them. I've also found sexist and racist players on this game. It's baffling how toxic most of the community is.

I played this game for 10 years (since season 2) and here is what I have to say about it The owner company doesn't really care about the game being fun. They remove every fun mode, remove fun items, they removed fun maps like the 3vs3 map. The community is literally THE WORST community there is in any video game ever and Riot (the owner company) doesn't ban players enough (or not at all some times). The only way to get banned is by using bad language in the chat, you can troll for MANY games before getting caught. LoL over the years got many new champions with very complicated kits and reworked many fun to play champions into boring mediocre champions with no unique abilities. There are very few modes in League of Legends, two to be exact. ARAM which is five random picked champions which are not random at all actually. I've bought like 15 champions and ARAM ALWAYS gives me the free rotation champions and the same 2 champions I own. The most played and also most boring map is summoners rift which is a complete map in contrast to ARAM which is just one lane. Playing ranked games in League of Legends is the worst thing you can do for yourself. They are filled with angry players, troll, ragequiters and there is nothing really to gain buy getting high rank, maybe a specific champion skin in the end of the season and that's it. The game client is very buggy after all these years for some reason and RIOT doesn't really want to fix it. Despite all those negative stuff these game is very addictive especially in the early levels but it is also very frustrating. It is the only game I've ever played which half of time playing it you get frustrated and feel like you've earned nothing. It is never a "good day" when you lose a game in League of Legends and you want to play more in order to win and feel a bit better. Seriously you can't stop playing for the day on a loss, it feels really bad. Honestly, the development team has done a really good job in some aspects of the game but neglected the most important aspects of it! This game probably deserves a 4/10 score but I choose to give it a 0/10 because it is a really terrible game to spent your time on and I want to discourage everyone reading this review from playing it. LoL is very addictive and usually not fun. Even if you are playing with friends (which is definitely the best way to play) LoL is not fun 5/10 times. Do not start League of Legends for your own good!

League of Legends is one of those games you literally hate but love at the same time. Many champions to play, ways to play, strategies and tactics. I would call LoL more of a strategic game than a combat game. LoL is one of the best games to play with friends. Community is the dark side of LoL, extremely toxic people who take it way too seriously. Acidentally stole a kill? Gets called many slurs. Escaped from a definitely lost fight? Gets called coward and ruined the fight. Going to help mid laner as a support? Doomed your ADC to death. So if you want to play LoL be prepare for some toxicity.

No voice chat in a multiplayer game that requires teamwork. Their reasoning behind this decision is that they believe if people can talk to one another toxicity will increase. This doesn't seem to be the case, since compared to other games I've played; such as Overwatch, Apex Legends and Valorant, League has one of the most toxic communities. There are simple functions which can be added to address their concerns. An option to mute players and an option to not join VC either by default or when in game. The reason behind not adding VC is more likely due to incompetence or laziness, which is reflected in their client design and optimisation, server instability and lack of a proper banning system. The game is also designed to be more addicting than it is made to be an enjoyable experience. The sound effects of last hitting minions and getting a hefty shutdown reminds me of a slot machine at a casino and the match making and elo systems seems to try to keep you entrapped in your current elo. It is possible to rise in ranks, but promos just delays the process unnecessarily. Winning three out of five games seems reasonable since that is a win-rate over 50 percent, but that means within that window of five games you need to be lucky enough to either have two teams that are even in skill or your team having the advantage. If the matchmaking was better perhaps promos could be justified, but getting even teams seems to be a rare occurrence. Most of the time win percentages differ greatly e.g. my last 10 games had an average of 20% win rate disparity. Addicting game that makes you want to come back, but not enjoyable most of the time and leaves you unsatisfied.

Tesis el final de quienverso acto numero 1 y wea quien verso es un manga que fue dibujado por el mangaka famosamente conocido por sus obras como tiesoverso, chainsaw man , tokyo revengers y vagabond quienverso se basa en la vida cotidiana de nicholas joseph gallardo matus que estudiaba en el colegio humberto vilches hasta que llego un compañero nuevo a su curso. llamado ernesto rodrigez federico matus y asi fue como se hizo el grupo de amigos que cambiaron la vida de muchas personas incluyendo demandas peleas doxxeos y weas mas acto numero 2 y wea ahora voy a explicar la demografia y porque los cambios de demografia que se han ido dando mediante el transcurso de los capitulos primero empezo como un shonen slice of life escolar pero en ciertas situaciones del manga se podria decir que hubo un cambio de demografia abrupto entre capitulos como la vez que unos de los integrantes peliaron a muerte en el patio del colegio por el amor de una chica. pero vayamos al grano que son los personajes tan humanos que trata la trama el mangaka supo plasmar en el papel el crecimiento humano de un adolecente normal chileno de clase media baja todos sus personajes tienen desarrollos tan complejos que solo pocos mangakas han podido saber retratar. los personajes principales tienen sus propios arcos personales que se ven reflejados en como se tratan entre ellos y tambien otro aspecto bastante reconocible a sido la comedia que se trata en el manga que es muy excepcional y podria sacarle una risa a mas de uno acto numero 3 y wea pero ahora vayamos al grano que es en si el final de quienverso parte 1 que el mangaka ya a confirmado que habra parte 2 el final de quienverso es un final espectacular se a visto todo el desarrollo de personaje y lo han hecho ver en unos de los plot twist mas grandes de todos los tiempos revelando a apio como el verdadero traidor del grupo y que causo muchos de los conflictos dados en el manga un final que aclaro muchas preguntas pero tambien dejo muchas preguntas por resolver por ejemplo si ernesto revivira o si las teorias de redvevo serian veridicas en conclusion quienverso es una obra maestra de magnitudes colosales no creo que ningun manga que a sido publicado en la historia pueda superar al trabajo de nicholas joseph gallardo matus una historia grandiosa, personajes extrañables y muy bien desarrollados, entornos bien cuidados y dados para la situacion tambien hay drama de por medio y la comedia no se queda atras por lo tanto quienverso parte 1 es definitivamente el mejor manga del siglo superando a obras como berserk o steel ball run. acto numero 4 y wea

The community is toxic. The matchmaking is extremely broken, as you can easily get in games with level 300 players as a level 15. The game is completely unbalanced end the 5 bans per team wouldn't even be enough if everyone banned op characters. The game has it's moments but these happen 1/100. Wouldn't recommend if you want fun for longer times. If you just want to play the tutorial it's great.

Honestly the game is really unbalanced, the newest champ literally have items built into their kits, Riot games doesn't give a **** about user experience or even what they think is fair, the pro's have more impact over the company than anyone else, and if they don't like you they will just call up their Riot friend to ban you. The community is soo toxic I haven't gone a single day without hearing the words "Kill yourself, ****" you can have only the enemy nexus left (last tower to destroy) lose 1 fight and you lose the game even though you are 12k gold ahead and have mega minions and dragon soul ! It is impossible to climb the ranks, you can't play the champs that you like cause the meta says otherwise, if you don't play what's meta you are trolling, or its a given loss. I will pray every night that Riot Games' servers burn down ! The game turned me into a ****ing monster, becoming toxic to friends and family, it turned me away from my religion so many times.

In short, toxic community, (I know its hard) about every season is there another misbalance, and it needs more time to be put in than any other game (, but i think thats normal for mobas). But in the end, if you play with friends it can be much fun.

The community is pretty terrible. And the game design needs to fix what they currently got out. Instead of just constantly releasing new content. Also, don't punish other players for bad team mates. Other than that, really fun and addictive. A character for everyone.

Riot doesn't care about its game. Every new champs are poorly balanced, way to overpowered and the whole meta inclines to the hyper fast damage. Making everything but tanks and assassin completely useful. Forcing you to play only the newest overpowered champs. So if you like mages, or you practiced an old champ. Well you will be always in disadvantage. Now everything that its on the game most have hyper mobility with hyper damage or its useless. And all the new champs abilities are automatic, no need to aim, or improve. So no matter if you practice an try to improve in the game. Since it needs 0 skill to catch and you can't dodge. If you are for example a slow/mage champ, you are dead and can't do anything about it. So yeah this game **** because if forces you to play only the overpowered champs, which are basically like 20. The rest are weird to see, since well they are completely useless.

If I could rate this game below 0, I would. It's literally utter garbage. Every online mechanic lacks of polish as well. Also matchmaking system is a joke, and many, many more problems. Don't play. Avoid and never support this game or Riot in general.

The Game is buggy at best with some standing for years now, the community is toxic and combined with their idiotic ban systems there isn't much choice besides disabling chat which is somewhat funny whyd they bother to have one in the first place. if you think about typing anything that would even remotely critisice either their mummy puppet company out of communist china or some feminist tumblr user youre banned and youre honor level is busted. the gameplay is clunky for the most part and their mission to implement new champions that are so insanely broken gets even toped by their great ideas for champion reworks, which are so powerful afterwards that patch after patch youll lose every bit of motivation to even waste storage space on this game e.g. mundo rework. the graphics are decent but theyre mostly on a level of a mobile game and not a pc game which in 2021 is just a clown show. their customer support is a mostly bot answering non sense which doesnt help you at anything and should you get the chance to have a human answer its aswell as a bot since they copy paste some pre written script answers which in short are something along the line of were not sorry for anything and we dont give a damn about you and we wont do anything about any of your problems so either google it or make a new account should i be something account related. overall the game is basically done for and at a stage where its trying to beat out wow on whos faster going to die as a game which is difficult considering wow and blizzard do have some sort of a head start at it, but leagues going there aswell

There is a lot of reviews coming from people who are bashing this game because it is too complicated or they are playing another game from MOBA genre, like DOTA (2) or (dying) HoN. League of Legends is a solid production, still being polished by Riot Games and it looks gorgeous for its low hardware requirements. In my humble opinion, this game would be the greatest on-line experience ever if it had better community. EDIT: I wrote this review in 2013 and I was hoping for Riot to fix some issues... they plague the game to this day. Aforementioned community is a dumpster fire, balance is a metronome. When the best thing that they manage to do are the cosmetics you know that it is time to go.

Long time ago you could get champions by just playing the game. You could buy a champion every week. Now this game has become strong Pay2Win. You get blue essence earlier IP only when you lvl up and get the lvl up boxes etc. I've been playing for weeks and couldn't buy me not even one champion since blue essence is so rare and hard to get. Same goes for events. You have to purchase an battle pass to get all event rewards. Sadly but this game has become Pay2Win. Also you can't play a game without having flamer in your or enemy team. EVERY game. It's like 99% of the player base are children who can not play the game without flame their team. Riot please remove tanks out of the game. This class is totally useless sinse there are so many ways to easily kill tanks. I hardly ever seen a tank being so useless like in this game. Also I play only ARAM because people can not stop babysitting in normal games. The sad thing is that there are like 1 million champions but you can play only like 20 of them in Aram. Why we can not just play all of the we own Riot? Sometimes I get killed by invisible projectiles. How is that even a thing? I walk behind the tower and BAM am dead. Also the lag... the lag is real in this 12 year old game.

Game is average. 'Roles' are awful - would rather just play than have people shout for being 'top' or 'bot' or 'jungle' or whatever. If you are 'jungle' it really isn't possible - If 2 guys are on one lane and ranking up together it's okay, but you get a load of silly little nerds who ping ping ping ping if you are in their lane.. Even though it's literally impossible to rank up without being in a lane until like level 10 or something. I paid this game 10 dollars but I wish I hadn't.

Listen to a veteran who plays game since 2012, and was gold in many seasons. For ignorants who gonna scream "hardstuck gold"> i play for skin only, I dont want to enter worlds. This game is TERRIBLE, especially if you gonna play for rank. I constantly get paired with people who go 0/10 and afk, in RANKED matches. And guess what? Those who ruin games dont get bans, even if they cant counterbuild and make terrible picks which have no real impact on late game. BUT, IF U WILL TELL SOMEBODY THAT HE IS **** FEEDER, chances of getting ban are really high. Company doesnt care about broken match making and punishing (or at least demoting) crap players. Instead they care about keeping game "social and civil", making serious players quit. Want to read more, check this: ****/13m80jq Taken from Trustpilot. Evil company just wants u to waste time going back/forth in rank so that they will have high statistics of "heavy loaded servers with lot of players".

It's been many years since I first ventured out to try one of the most popular mutliplayer game titles - League of Legends. LOL has left me with a dozen memories, as I've spent hundreds of hours there. Unfortunately, that was back when the game still contained a max level of 30. It wasn't until later that they added the ability to level up, and that was back when I wasn't playing, but that's beside the point. Back to LOL itself. The game caught my eye right off the bat. The simple graphics here just appealed to me, and the game is ultimately a lot clearer than Dota, which I only played for a few hours and was absolutely lost. But here, after a while, you pick up what and how and that makes the game more accessible to more people. It didn't take long for me to tell my friends about LOLku back in I think it was 2015, and they subsequently downloaded the game and we started playing together regularly. The rules of the game are pretty clear. Two teams of five players and both teams have an inhibitor they have to protect and they have to destroy the other team's inhibitor, only to get to it they have to go through towers that start giving you damage and so you die after a while. So the only way to get to the enemy inhibitor is to destroy these towers and this will make the game longer and in the end one game will take around 30-50 minutes. You can still kill the dragon, which will give your team advantages. To top it all off, you still earn goals during gameplay. For killing enemies, for destroying enemy towers and so on. You can then buy items with the coins, which give you upgrades in the form of damage, HP and so on. The player gets into it pretty quickly, and the biggest obstacle is perhaps just the lack of knowledge of the characters' abilities. Once you get into it, however, you're in for hundreds of hours of fun doing the same thing over and over again, but for each match you get a Blue Essence (still an IP then, but now it's Blue Essence) and you can then unlock more champions with that currency. On top of that, you also level up, so the game doesn't lack a sense of progression. There are also skins or the ability to unlock a champion right away for real money, but so some of those microtransactions are already expected in a F2P title and personally I think League of Legends is not a pay-to-win game. On top of that as I mentioned the game is free, which is fine. Overall for me it is a good game and if you don't know what to play with your friends, League of Legends is such an obvious choice. Just beware of the community, which is perhaps the most toxic I've ever experienced. I've never seen so much swearing and I slept with your mom type stuff.

Worst community ever. Worst developer ever. The matchmaking system for this game is so broken. If you get unlucky to get matched with new player or match with trolls for a few games in a row, the system the put you with other players who are just as bad because they think you have lost the game so you aren't skilled. You point this out to the support staff and the ether call you a liar or ignore the feedback. The devs for this game are just as bad they have know idea on how to balance the system or balance the champs there is so many champs that are over powered and these champs just get ignore. The devs also aren't interested in making the game fair and fun they just make changes that sound cool and exciting but are horrible to lane against. Riot Games are only interested in making as much money as possible and aren't interested with the part of the community that want game to be fair and fun to play. They want people to spend £10 plus on one skin for a champ yet they can just rework the champs at anytime. That means you could be stuck with skins for champs that you no longer enjoy playing as they don't take feedback on any changes that get made to the game. They have a test server that the community can make an account on but its not for getting feedback on change or new champs that they make. Its only there to make sure there no bugs. Riot Games aren't interested in the player that play there game.

putting aside the bad community and unbalanced game issue, the ranking system in LOL is a joke. This is due to the MMR nonsense and the forced LP loss on dodging Riot implement which heavily affects how well you climb. For everytime you win or go on a win streak, you win end up getting losses and lose streak because the next 1/3 of the time you get smurfs that stomp roll, the other 1/3 you get clueless otps/offrole players that dont have a clue what they are supposed to do, and the other 1/3 you get trolls that purposely feeds the enemy and then they may go AFK after screwing your game because they were just having fun, at your expense of course. And then after you dodge a game because you get into a such a team using addons like porofessor, you are forced to play another game with this same type of players because you will incur penalty for dodging games. So "Have fun" spending time with the OTP ezreal in midlane up against zedman 0/5 by the 10th min and refuse to surrender, wasting another 30 mins of your time, because "dodging is Bad and will cause MMR inflation", and guess what? you will still lose lp not due to any fault of your own. Even card games takes less RNG then this joke ****. The only way i can see you climbing a realistically losing matchup is by 2v5 the entire enemy team that was fed with their team having 1 or 2 smurfs, possible? yea, Nearly impossible? definitely. And you lose 18 lp but gain 9 lp, i guess riot 200 years experience makes you think you have a machine as a brain that can function in perfect mode all the time, HAHAHAHAHA Oh and this game is a heavily disguised pay to win. After playing for more then a year i only unlock half of the champs pool in this game. To get more champs you either invest insane amount of time or spend $$ on passes, and the forums are filled with fanbois that downvote anything negative to our chinese emperors, but i will give it 2 stars because it does not hide the fact that it is a chinese company, unlike a certain big gaming company in the west LOL LOL.

I've been playing this game since open beta, so I have a ton of experience of all the changes the game has went through. First of, if you are ONLY looking at the visual side of things, holy crap, the game has improved a lot. It was pretty ugly and all the models were very low polygon count. Nowadays it's far greater graphically, map is super nice, spells look super flashy and well created. But the gameplay has taken... ummm... a slight downturn. I never understood the necessity of bushes but I let that go since you were always able to put a ward down. Nowadays every single lane has like 3 bushes, so there's never enough actual vision you can achieve to protect yourself from ganks. In old days when you got ahead or got ganked, you purchased 75g ward and were relatively safe. Now you buy pink ward and you're burning that ward out with saving maybe a second or two from an individual gank. Ward gets taken down and you can't do anything. Now if you have AFK teammember, you no longer are able to go to soak lane or go to jungle, in case something went wrong in champion select. You're FORCED into a role and the system has been tweaked so hard to not allow any variety. I cleared red, blue and frog with Graves without smite and I was still level 1. Also there's a lot of champions that got weaker over time for no good reason. Talon used to be amazing assassin who could delete opponent. Now he's much slower to gank and his burst does far more damage than a single Leblanc Q+W. Maybe he's gotten little safer to escape after ganks but I liked the old kit where he was able to 1v5 when fed. Xerath used to have a cool unique technique that was fully counterable by strong initiate, that got taken away while he still retains the strong burst and range. I miss the old Galio who could play as support. Now you're pretty much forced mid because you can't survive 2v2 without very specific set of runes and having ultra aware ADC, enemy who over extends etc. There's just so many champions that can do better than him. This game needs to go back to its roots (mechanically) and take some steps to make each champion to have an unique Strength rather than having every new champion overloaded with 10 different mechanics. I mean it's cool to play them, but you're pretty much forced to one trick champion nowadays if you attempt to do any climbing, and playing one champion is ULTRA boring. I miss the time I could just pick something wacky like Sion support and just spam stun and shield explosion, use money to buy wards and roam. A place where we could experiment new things. Now you're pretty much forced to babysit ADC because all your money generation items require having a teammate next to you. I think the community took huge dump downward in season 3 and forward and nowadays you cannot go a single game without someone getting blamed for trolling or intentionally feeding or just asking to report for no reason. I still play it because I like the game, but I feel it has now far less skill expression due to how much less vision you're able to give to your team if you're not support, or if you're support, how little you're allowed to roam, how easy it's to die when behind. Oh I almost forgot the extremely high snowball due to how much damage s10 and s11 have wrought with first the rune rework (everyone was complaining the damage was too high) and now s11 where the main core items get given in full strength, easily doing an additional 200 damage boost from abilities, or/and leaping character forward. I guess the items could be good buy there already was summoners which were supposed to be these ultimate rescue items. Now you got Jhin with Heal who speeds up, flash, slow due to trap and 2nd leap with item, and you literally cannot catch this immobile champ anymore, and it's supposed to be its weakness. Baron buff is way too strong now and dragons give permanent buffs that are impossible to be gained. Rift Herald was cool at first but should have been severely nerfed. Jeesus, if you have some champs with ability to kill towers fast on a solo lane, and you get killed by ganks, you might lose all towers and even the first tower in core. It's just too much.

this game is feces. you will do yourself the biggest disservice by investing time in it. the matchmaking is geared towards making you lose. you gain less lp when you win than when you lose LP. people are very likely to grief rather than play their best. this game will have a few good moments but will be 90% awful miserable test of patience. you will find out for your self if you choose to take it on. I AM PRAYING THIS GAME DIES, or at least goes the same way HOTS did. it doesn't deserve the attention it gets. NORTH AMERICA does awful in the pro scene. nothing worth enjoying, unless you play with a team full of your friends, in which case go find a more friendly game that is worth playing solo until your friends join you. this game should get a negative rating not a 0.

I have been playing this game since my childhood so it's very dear to me. So sad to see what this game has become. Here are my thoughts: 1. For new players i strongly recommend to play this game. It was very fun to see yourself learning the game and improving each day. And after some time, you will hit lvl30 and unlock "ranked game mode". 2. DO NOT PLAY RANKED ! Ranked games are rigged ! The game will on purpose give you bad teammates if your win rate is high and bad enemy if it's low. So losing will make you feel angry and want to play more. On the other hand, winning won't make you feel satisfied since you didn't actually beat good players. 3. Updates in this game happens quite often ( usually buffs of nerfs to some champions ). But they still always leave some champions stronger than others, making them get picked more often. And it's actually really stupid how unbalanced those champions are. But in the end of the day, this game is very fun if you have no idea what is happening xD

Я играл в эту игру с 2014-ого, в 2018-ом имел даймонд ранг и как раз в этот год игра ускорила темп скатывания в помойку. Сейчас влияние твоих навыков в микроигре нулевое. Роумы удалены благодаря щиткам которые дают пассивный голд тем кто отыгрывал хуже и не может роумить, в итоге камбекая им, так как голда с роумов не компенсирует даже 2 щитка. Распределение опыта крайне неадекватное. Удалена механика увеличивающая количество опыта из отставания от среднего лвла, таким образом в ситуации когда к вам приходят три человека и стомпят ваш фарм стоя на линии и поукая вас под тавер заставляя бекнуть нет компенсации и это приводит к доминации так как потерянный пак опыта для вас уже никак нельзя компенсировать. Разумеется ни о каком личном влиянии на ситуацию здесь говорить нельзя. Описания скилов каждого нового чемпиона больно читать, ведь ты понимаешь что на этот раз получилось еще более неадекватно чем все до этого. Это подходит для пве игр, а не для пвп в котором ты крайне вероятно будешь часто этим скилам пытаться противостоять. Большая часть игры выигрывается в лобби, не забанил-не пикнул - наиболее вероятно проиграл. Так же вероятность твоего личного успеха крайне рандомна и зависит не столько от твоих навыков сколько от скомпонованности вражеской команды. Ведь системы наказаний для игроков тратящих время без весомого профита здесь просто нет. Джанглер может спокойно простоять на твоем варде до его спадания, после выйти, выгнать тебя с лайна и при этом практически не потеряет в опыте, как ровно и любой другой лейнер. Это по сути один из основных недостатков калечащих пвп в этой игре, так как цена чужой ошибки нулевая. Вы будете видеть людей которые с радостью проиграют вам ранкед по абсолютно тупым поводам. Крайне редко срабатывают репорты по абсолютно любому пункту. Когда-то я состоял в гильдии с человеком который пошел интить игру своей же гильдии, писал в чат о том что нажимает райтклик на вражеский тавер и играет в мобилку, после 4 репортов от нашей гильдии на следующий же день я снова встретил его в игре. Да, скины в этой игре прекрасны и это единственная причина по которой эта игра все еще жива. Люди донатят на приятную часть контента продолжая играть (или нет, главное ведь что уже оплатили) в этот шлак. Популярность стримов обуславливается тем что игроки получают бонусы в игре вися на стриме афк. Красочные ролики с песнями о том как вы будете подниматься к вершине и мотивирующие вас вступать в соревнование это прекрасный неотразимый маркетинговый ход, но к самой игре это не имеет никакого отношения, обычная реклама. Вы можете проводить в ней море времени и выехать в высокое эло просто случайно, но негатив испытанный в процессе того полностью не стоит, у эло больше нет ценности.

This is the game of the decade and has potencial to keep up the success. As a pvp free-to-play game, the only thing that matters for the players to improve in the game is to get deep knowledge of the mechanics and macro play. No lootboxes that give you any advantage against other players, just cosmetics loot boxes that are easily obtained for free as long as you play the game. Great investment of Riot Games in Tournaments which keep the game alive and entertain the public. This game is a slap on the face of P2W based games of how to succeed as a game's company.
