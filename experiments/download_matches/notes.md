Experiment: Test chatbots to see if they have baked-in knowledge of LoL
- ChatGPT and Claude know what freezing is, how to do it, and the benefits
- Claude knows what Tear is but gets its stats completely wrong
- conclusion: for specific stats, some ground truth is needed thru a database or web search tool call

Experiment: just feed an LLM a bunch of my match history and ask it what it thinks
