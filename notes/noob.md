The biggest problems with learning league:
Learning Curve and Complexity
The most frequently mentioned barrier is the overwhelming complexity. New players struggle with:

Learning abilities and mechanics for 160+ champions
Understanding complex game systems (items, runes, macro strategy)
The steep learning curve that takes months to even grasp basics
No adequate tutorial system to teach essential concepts

Hostile Community Environment
Multiple reviewers emphasize how unwelcoming the game is to beginners:

Players are "flamed" and insulted for making mistakes
Zero tolerance for learning - mistakes are treated harshly
Toxic behavior from teammates who expect perfection immediately
New players often encounter smurfs (experienced players on new accounts) who dominate matches

Matchmaking Issues
Several reviews highlight problematic matchmaking for newcomers:

New players matched against much more experienced opponents
Presence of smurfs disrupts fair matches for genuine beginners
Inconsistent skill levels within matches
Long queue times that can discourage continued play

Time Investment Requirements
Many reviews mention the significant time commitment needed:

Individual matches lasting 30-45+ minutes
Hundreds of hours required just to understand basic gameplay
Need for extensive practice to become minimally competent
Difficulty progressing without substantial time investment

Technical and Interface Issues
Some players struggle with:

Unintuitive camera controls and UI elements
Client stability problems and bugs
Difficulty with basic mechanics like last-hitting minions

The reviews paint a picture of a game that can be rewarding for dedicated players but presents substantial barriers to newcomers, particularly around community toxicity and the sheer amount of knowledge required to play competently.
